THE PRINCE
By Niccolo Machiavelli
Translated by Luigi Ricci; revised by E. R. P. Vincent for Oxford University Press (1935).

Hereditary principalities are maintained with fewer difficulties than new dominions so long as the ruling line adapts to circumstances.
A wise prince must rely on his own arms and native militias rather than mercenaries if he wants lasting security.
Prudence sometimes requires that a ruler accept being feared rather than loved when stability is at stake.
Machiavelli closes with an appeal for the princes of Italy to unite and drive the barbarians from the peninsula.
