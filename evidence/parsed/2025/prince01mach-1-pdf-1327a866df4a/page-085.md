74 NICCOL0 MACHIAVELLI
confidence does not render him incautious, and
too much diffidence does not render him in-

to be both feared and loved, but as it isdifficult
for the two to go togelher, it is much safer to be
feared than loved , ifone of the two has to be
wanting. For it may be said of men in general
that they are ungrateful, voluble, dissemblers,
anxious to avoid danger, and covetous of gain;
as long as you benefit them, they are entirely
yours; they offer you their blood, their goods,
their life,and their children, as I have before
said, when the necessity is remote; but when it
approaches, they revolt. And the prince who
has relied solely on their words, without making
other preparations, is ruined; for the friendship
which is gained by purchase and not through
grandeur and nobility of spirit is bought but not
secured, and at a pinch is not to be expended
in your service. And men have less scruple in
offending one who makes himself loved than one

chain of obligation which, men being selfish, is
broken whenever itserves their purpose; but fear
is maintained by a dread of punishment which
never fails.
Still, a prince should make himself feared in
such a way that if he does not gain love, he at
any rate avoids hatred; for fear and the absence
of hatred may well gp together, and will be
always attained by one who abstains from inter-
