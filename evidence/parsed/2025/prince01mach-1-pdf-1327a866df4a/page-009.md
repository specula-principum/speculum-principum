PREFACE
he publication of a new edition of Luigi
TRicci’s translation of II Principe has given
opportunity for a complete revision. Over thirty
years have passed since its firstappearance and
during that time the text of the Italian original
has been the subject of research which has re-
sulted in a definitive edition. 1 This text, on which
the present revision isbased, is derived from acol-
lation ofthe Gotha MS. with nine others identified
as belonging to two distinct groups, and varies
in important respects from that originally used
by Ricci. As far as we are aware no translation
has appeared in England since the publication
of the revised text in 1929.
The fortune of II Principe in this country has
been a curious one. The book was written in
1513 and firstpublished in 1532, but no English
translation is known before that of Edward
Dacres in 1640. The existence of a French ver-
sion (1553) and a Latin translation (1566) is
not sufficient to explain the familiarity of the
Elizabethans with the Machiavelli of II Prin-
cipe, a Machiavelli distorted into a monster of
iniquity, ifnot into the devil himself. Manuscript
translations of the Principe undoubtedly existed
long before Dacres’ publication, and it is par-
ticularly interesting to record a Scots transla-
tion by William Fowler (probably written 1580-
159°) seeing that Machiavelli was early known
