CHAPTER XXII
OF THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES
1I 'he choice ofa prince’s ministers isa matter of
no littleimportance; they are either good or
not according to the prudence of the prince.
The first impression that one gets of a ruler and
of his brains is from seeing the men that he has
about him. When they are competent and faith-
ful one can always consider him wise, as he has
been able to recognise their ability and keep
them faithful. But when they are the reverse,
one can always form an unfavourable opinion of
him, because the first mistake that he makes is
in making this choice.
There was nobody who knew Messer Antonio
da Venafro as the minister of Pandolfo Petrucci,
Prince of Siena, who did not consider Pandolfo
to be a very prudent man, having him for his
minister. There are three different kinds of
brains, the one understands things unassisted,
the other understands things when shown by
others, the third understands neither alone nor
with the explanations of others. The first kind is
most excellent, the second also excellent, but the
third useless. It is therefore evident that if Pan-
dolfo was not of the first kind, he was at any
rate of the second. For every time the prince
has the judgment to know the good and evil
that any one does or says, even ifhe has no origi-
nality of intellect, yet he can recognise the bad
and good works of his minister and correct the
one and encourage the other; and the minister
