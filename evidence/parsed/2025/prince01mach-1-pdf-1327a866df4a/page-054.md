to leadership by popular favour finds himself
alone, and has no one, or very few, who are
not ready to obey him. Besides which, it isim-

very easy to satisfy the mass of the people in this

the hostility ofthe great, as they are but few. The
worst that a prince has to expect from a hostile
people isto be abandoned, but from hostile nobles

obliged to live always with the same people, but
he can easily do without the same nobility, being
able to make and unmake them at any time, and
improve their position or deprive them of itas he

are either to be ruled so as to make them entirely
dependent on your fortunes, or else not. Those
that are thus bound to you and are not rapacious,
must be honoured and loved; those who stand
aloof must be considered in two ways, they
either do this through pusillanimity and natural
