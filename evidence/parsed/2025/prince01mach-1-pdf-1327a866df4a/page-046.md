THE PRINCE 35

S7one~ean find n6"Better example than the ac- .
tions of this man. The only thing he can be
accused"t5f is that in the creation of Julius II he
made a bad choice; for, as has been said, not
being able to choose his own pope, he could still
prevent any one individual being made pope,
and he ought never to have permitted any of
those cardinals to be raised to the papacy whom
he had injured, or who when pope would stand
in fear of him. For men commit injuries either .
through fear or through hate. Those whom he
had injured were, among others, San Pietro ad
Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio.
All the others, if elected to the pontificate, would
have had to fear him except Rohan and the
Spaniards; the latter through their relationship
and obligations to him, the former from his great
power, being related to the King ofFrance. For
these reasons the duke ought above all things to
have created a Spaniard pope; and ifunable,
then he should have consented to Rohan being
appointed and not San Pietro ad Vincula. And
whoever thinks that in high personages new S
benefits cause old offences to be forgotten, makes
a great mistake. The duke, therefore, erred in
this choice, and it was the cause of his ulti-
mate ruin.
