88 NICCOL0 machiavelli
whose natures, as I said before, it is necessary
for a prince to imitate. Knowing the klgtliofthe
Emperor Julianus, Severus, who was leader of
the army in Slavonia, persuaded the troops that
itwould be well to go to Rome to avenge the
death of Pertinax, who had been slain by the
Praetorian guard, and under this pretext, without

decided to attack Nigrinus and deceive Albinus,
to whom he wrote that having been elected
emperor by the senate he wished to share that
dignity with him; he sent him the title of Caesar
and, by deliberation of the senate, he was de-

deprived him of both his position and his life.
