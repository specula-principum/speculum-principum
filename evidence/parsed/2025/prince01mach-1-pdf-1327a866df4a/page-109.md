they were of little use to her when Cesare
Borgia attacked her and the people being hostile
to her allied themselves with the foreigner. So
that then and before it would have been safer
for her not to have been hated by the people than
to have had the fortresses. Having considered

and would blame any one who, trusting in them,
recks littleof being hated by his people.
