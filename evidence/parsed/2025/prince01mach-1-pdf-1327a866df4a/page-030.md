THE PRINCE 19
isted in those states; for, as long as the memory
of these lasted, the Romans were always un-
certain of their conquest; but when the memory
of these principalities had been extinguished
and with the power and duration of the empire,
they became unchallenged masters. When the
Romans fell out amongst themselves, any one of
them could count on the support of that part of
the province where he had established authority.
The Romans alone were recognised as rulers
there after the extinction of the old line of
princes. Considering these things, therefore, let
no one be surprised at the facility with which
Alexander was able to hold Asia, and at the
difficulties that others have had in holding con-
quered territories,like Pyrrhus and many others;
as this was not caused by the greater or lesser
ability of the conqueror, but depended on the
dissimilarity of the conditions.
