72 NICCOLd MACHIAVELLI
And should any one reply that there have been
many princes, who have done great things with
their armies, who have been thought extremely
liberal, I would answer by saying that the prince
may either spend his own wealth and that of his
subjects or the wealth of others. In the first case
he must be sparing, but for the rest he must not
neglect to be very liberal. The liberality isvery
necessary to a prince who marches with his
armies, and lives by plunder, sack and ransom,
and is dealing with the wealth ofothers, for with-
out it he would not be followed by his soldiers.
And you may be very generous indeed with what
isnot the property ofyourselfor your subjects, as
were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; for spending
the wealth of others will not diminish your repu-
tation, but increase it, only spending your own
resources will injure you. There isnothing which
destroys itselfso much as liberality, for by using
it you lose the power of using it,and become
either poor and despicable, or, to escape poverty,
rapacious and hated. And of all things that a
prince must guard against, the most important
are being despicable or hated, and liberality will
lead you to one or other of these conditions. It
is,therefore, wiser to have the name of a miser,
which produces disgrace without hatred, than to
incur of necessity the name of being rapacious,
which produces both disgrace and hatred.
