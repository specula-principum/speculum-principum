CHAPTER XXIII
HOW FLATTERERS MUST BE SHUNNED
must not omit an important subject, and men-
I tion of a mistake which princes can with diffi-
culty avoid, ifthey are not very prudent, or if
they do not make a good choice. And this iswith
regard to flatterers, of which courts are full, be-
cause men take such pleasure in their own things
and deceive themselves about them that they can
with difficulty guard against this plague; and by
wishing to guard against it they run the risk of be-
coming contemptible. Because there is no other
way ofguarding one’s selfagainst flattery thajLby
letting men understand that they will not offend
VQtTby speaking the truth; but when every one
can telTyou TRetruth, you lose their respect. A
prudent prince must therefore take a third course,
jby choosing for his council wise men, and giving
these alone full liberty to speak the truth to him,
but only of those things that he asks and of
nothing else; but he must ask them about everv-
thing and hear their opinion, and afterwards
deliberate by himselfin his own way, and in these
couhcilsTand with each of these men comport
himself so that every one may see that the more
freely he speaks, the more he will be acceptable.
Beyond thesejhe should listen to no one, go about
the matter deliberately, and be determined in
his decisions. Whoever acts otherwise either acts
precipitately through flattery or else changes
often through the variety of opinions, from which
itfollows that he will be littleesteemed.
