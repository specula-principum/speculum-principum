84 NICCOL0 MACHIAVELLI
Giovanni was old enough to assume the govern-
ment.
I conclude, therefore, that a prince need trouble
littleabout conspiracies when the peoplcfare well
disposed, but when they are hostile and hold him
in hatred, then he must fear everything and
everybody. Well-ordered states and wise princes
have studied diligently not to drive the nobles to
desperation, and tosatisfy the populace and keep
it contented, for this isone of the most important
matters that a prince has to deal with.
Among the kingdoms that are well ordered
and governed in our time is France, and there
we find numberless good institutions on which
depend the liberty and security of the king; of
these the chiefis the parliament and itsauthority,
because he who established that kingdom, know-
ing the ambition and insolence of the great
nobles, deemed it necessary to have a bit in their
mouths to check them. And knowing on the
other hand the hatred of the mass of the people
against the great, based on fear,and wishing to se-
cure them, he did notwish to make thisthe special
care of the king, to relieve him of the dissatis-
faction that he might incur among the nobles by
favouring the people, and among the people by
favouring the nobles. He therefore established
a third judge that, without direct charge of the
king, kept in check the great and favoured the
lesser people. Nor could any better or more pru-
dent measure have been adopted, nor better pre-
caution for the safety of the king and the king-
dom. From which another notable rule can be
drawn, that princes should let the carrying out
\/ of unpopular duties devolve on others, and be-
