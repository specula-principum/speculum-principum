THE PRINCE 119
which can resist cavalry and need not fear in-
fantry, and this will be done by the choice of
arms and a new organisation. And these are the
things which, when newly introduced, give repu-
tation and grandeur to a new prince.
This opportunity must not, therefore, be al-
lowed to pass, so that Italy may at length find
her liberator. I cannot express the love with
which he would be received in all those pro-
vinces which have suffered under these foreign
invasions, with what thirst for vengeance, with
what steadfast faith, with what love, with what
grateful tears. What doors would be closed
against him? What people would refuse him
obedience? What envy could oppose him?
What Italian would withhold allegiance? This
barbarous domination stinks in the nostrils of
every one. May your illustrious house therefore
assume this task with that courage and those
hopes which are inspired by a just cause, so that
under its banner our fatherland may be raised
up, and under itsauspices be verified that saying
of Petrarch:
Valour againstfellwrath
Will take up arms; and be the combat quickly sped!
For, sure,the ancient worth,
That inItalians stirstheheart, isnot yet dead.
