Some may wonder how it came about that
Agathocles, and others like him, could, after in-
finite treachery and cruelty, live secure for many
years in their country and defend themselves
from external enemies without being conspired
against by their subjects; although many others
have, owing to their cruelty, been unable to
maintain their position in times of peace, not to
speak of the uncertain times of war. I believe
this arises from the cruelties being exploited well
or badly. Well committed may be called those
(ifit is permissible to use the word well of evil)
which are perpetrated once for the need of se-
curing one’s self,and which afterwards are not
persisted in, but are exchanged for measures as
useful to the subjects as possible. Cruelties ill
committed are those which, although at first
few, increase rather than diminish with time.
Those who follow the former method may
remedy in some measure their condition, both
with God and man; as did Agathocles. As to
the others, it is impossible for them to maintain
themselves.
Whence itis to be noted, that in taking a state
the conqueror must arrange to commit all his

them every day, and so as to be able, by not
making fresh changes, to reassure people and
win them over by benefiting them. Whoever acts
otherwise, either through timidity or bad coun-
sels,is always obliged to stand with knife in hand,
and can never depend on his subjects, because
they, owing to continually fresh injuries, are un-
able to depend upon him. For injuries should be
done alltogether, so thatbeing lesstasted, they will
