THE PRINCE 113
not conform to their method of procedure.
From this itresults, as I have said, that two men,

acting differently, attain the same effect, and of
two others acting in the same way, one attains
his goal and not the other. On this depend
also the changes in prosperity, for ifit happens
that time and circumstances are favourable to
one who acts with caution and prudence he will
be successful, but if time and circumstances
change he will be ruined, because he does not
change his mode ofprocedure. No man isfound
so prudent as to be able to adapt himself to this,
either because he cannot deviate from that to
which his nature disposes him, or else because
having always prospered by walking in one path,
he cannot persuade himself that it is well to
leave it;and therefore the cautious man, when
it is time to act suddenly, does not know how
to do so and is consequently ruined; for if one
could change one’s nature with time and cir-
cumstances, fortune would never change.
Pope Julius II acted impetuously in every-
thing he did and found the times and conditions
so in conformity with that mode of procedure,
that he always obtained a good result. Consider
the firstwar that he made against Bologna while
Messer Giovanni Bentivogli was stillliving. The
Venetians were not pleased with it,neither was
the King of Spain, France was conferring with
him over the enterprise, notwithstanding which,
owing to his fierce and impetuous disposition, he
engaged personally in the expedition. This move
caused both Spain and the Venetians to halt and
hesitate, the latter through fear, the former
through the desire to recover the entire kingdom
