THE PRINCE 67
stopped and asked them: If the enemy were on
that hill and we found ourselves here with our
army, which of us would have the advantage?
How could we safely approach him maintaining
our order? If we wished to retire, what ought
we to do? If they retired, how should we follow
them? And he put before them as they went
along all the contingencies that might happen to
an army, heard their opinion, gave his own, forti-
fying itby argument; so that thanks to these con-
stant reflections there could never happen any
incident when actually leading his armies for
which he was not prepared.
But as to exercise for the mind, the prince
ought to read history and study the actions of
eminent men, see how they acted in warfare,
examine the causes of their victories and defeats
in order to imitate the former and avoid the
latter, and above all,do as some men have done
in the past, who have imitated some one, who
has been much praised and glorified, and have
always kept his deeds and actions before them,
as they say Alexander the Great imitated Achilles,
Caesar Alexander, and Scipio Cyrus. And who-
ever reads the life ofCyrus written by Xenophon,
will perceive in the lifeofScipio how gloriously he
imitated the former, and how, in chastity, affa-
bility,humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed
to those qualities of Cyrus as described by Xeno-
phon.
A wise prince should follow similar methods
and never remain idle in peaceful times, but
industriously make good use of them, so that
when fortune changes she may find him prepared
to resisther blows, and to prevail in adversity.
