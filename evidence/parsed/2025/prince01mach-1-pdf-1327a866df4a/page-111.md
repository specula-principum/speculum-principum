100 NICCOL0 machiavelli
enterprise, and has lately attacked France; so
that he has continually contrived great things,
which have kept his subjects’ minds uncertain
and astonished, and occupied in watching their
result. And these actions have arisen one out of
the other, so that they have left no time for men
to settle down and act against him.
It is also very profitable for a prince to give
some outstanding example of his greatness in the
internal administration, like those related of
Messer Bernabo of Milan. When it happens that
some one does something extraordinary, either
good or evil,in civil life,he must find such means
of rewarding or punishing him which will be
much talked about. And above all a prince
must endeavour in every action to obtain fame
for being great and excellent.
A prince is further esteemed when he is a true
friend or a true enemy, when, that is, he de-
clares himself without reserve in favour of some
one or against another. This policy is always
more useful than remaining neutral. For iftwo
neighbouring powers come to blows, they are
either such that ifone wins, you will have to fear
the victor, or else not. In either of these two
cases it will be better for you to declare your-
self openly and make war, because in the first
case ifyou do not declare yourself, you will fall
a prey to the victor, to the pleasure and satis-
faction of the one who has been defeated, and
you will have no reason nor anything to de-
fend you and nobody to receive you. For,
whoever wins will not desire friends whom he
suspects and who do not help him when jn
trouble, and whoever loses will not receive you
