# Dedicatory Letter
Piero Soderini is urged to consider the lessons within this treatise on civic governance and prudent leadership.

# Chapter I - Hereditary Principalities
Hereditary principalities are maintained with fewer difficulties than new dominions so long as the ruling line adapts to circumstances and honors prior customs.

# Chapter II - Mixed Principalities
Princes who acquire new territories must blend existing laws with their own innovations while carefully appointing trusted civic ministers.

# Chapter III - Military Preparedness
A wise prince must rely on native militias and layered fortifications rather than mercenaries if he wants lasting administrative security.

# Chapter XVII - On Cruelty and Clemency
Prudence sometimes requires that a ruler accept being feared rather than loved when municipal stability is at stake, provided he avoids hatred.

# Chapter XXI - On Reputation
Measured generosity, transparent fiscal stewardship, and targeted patronage keep citizens loyal without exhausting the treasury.

# Chapter XXVI - Exhortation to Liberate Italy
Machiavelli closes with an appeal for the princes of Italy to unite and drive the barbarians from the peninsula, realigning governance toward shared security.
