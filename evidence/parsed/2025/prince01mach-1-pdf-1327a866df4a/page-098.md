THE PRINCE 87
added because he was old, he was ruined at the
very beginning of his administration.
Whence it may be seen that hatred is gained
as much by good works as by evil, and therefore,
as I said before, a prince who wishes to maintain
the state isoften forced to do evil, for when that
party, whether populace, soldiery, or nobles,
whichever- it be that you consider necessary to
you for keeping your position, is corrupt, you
must follow its humour and satisfy it,and in that
case'good^works will be inimical to you. But let
us come toWlexander, who was ofsuch goodness,
that among other things for which he ispraised,
itissaid that in the fourteen years that he reigned
no one was put to death by him without a fail-
trial. Nevertheless, being considered effeminate,
and a man who allowed himself to be ruled by
his mother, and having thus fallen into contempt,
the army conspired against him and killed him.
Considering, on the other hand, the qualities of
Commodus, Severus, Antoninus, Caracalla, and
Maximinus, you will find them extremely cruel
and rapacious; to satisfy the soldiers there was no
injury which they would not inflicton the people,
and all except Severus ended badly. Severus,
however, had such abilities that by maintaining
the soldiers friendly to him, he was able to reign
happily, although he oppressed the people, for
his virtues made him so admirable in the sight
both of the soldiers and the people that the latter
were, in some degree, astonished and stupefied,,
while the former were respectful and contented.
As the deeds ofthis ruler were great and notable
for a new prince, I will briefly show how well he
could use the qualities of the fox and the lion,
