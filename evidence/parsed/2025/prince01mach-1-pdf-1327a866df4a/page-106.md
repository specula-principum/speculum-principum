THE PRINCE 95
aforesaid motives, fomented the Guelfand Ghib-
elline factions in the cities subject to them, and
although they never allowed them to come to
bloodshed, they yet encouraged these differ-
ences among them, "o that the citizens, being
occupied in their own quarrels, might not act
against them. This, however, did not avail them
anything, as was seen when, after the defeat
of Vaila, a part of those subjects immediately
took courage and seized the whole state. Such
methods, besides, argue weakness in a prince,
for in a strong government such dissensions will
never be permitted. They are profitable only in
time of peace, as by such means it is easy to
manage one’s subjects, but when it comes to war,
the fallacy of such a policy isat once shown.
Without doubt princes become great when
they overcome difficulties and opposition, and
therefore fortune, especially when it wants to
render a new prince great, who has greater need
of gaining a great reputation than a hereditary
prince, raises up enemies and compels him to
undertake wars against them, so that he may
have cause to overcome them, and thus climb
up higher by means of that ladder which his
enemies have brought him. There_axe_many
who think therefore that a wise prince ought,
when he has the chance, to foment astutely some
enmity, so that by suppressing it he will augment
his greatness.
Princes, and especially new ones, have found
more faith and more usefulness in those men,
whom at the beginning of their power they re-
garded with suspicion, than in those they at first
confided in. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince ofSiena,
