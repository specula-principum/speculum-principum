34 NICCOL0 MACHIAVELLI
not had those two armies upon him, or else had
been in good health, he would have survived
every difficulty. And that his foundations were
good is seen from the fact that the Romagna
waited for him more than a month; in Rome,
although half dead, he remained secure, and al-
though the Baglioni, Vitelli, and Orsini entered
Rome they found no followers against him. He
was able, if not to make pope whom he wished,
at any rate to prevent a pope being created
whom he did not wish. But if at the death of
Alexander he had been well, everything would
have been easy. And he told me on the day that
Pope Julius II was elected, that he had thought
of everything which might happen on the death
of his father, and provided against everything,
except that he had never thought that at his
father’s death he would be dying himself.
Reviewing thus all the actions of the duke, I
find nothing to blame, on the contrary, I feel
bound, as I have done, to hold him up as an ex-
ample to be imitated by all who by fortune and
with the arms ofothers have risen to power. For
with his great courage and high ambition he
could not have acted otherwise, and his designs
were only frustrated by the short life of Alex-
ander and his own illness. Whoever, therefore,
deems it necessary in his new~principaIItyto
_
