and if it is not natural affection for him, but
only because they were not contented with the
state as it was, he will have great trouble and
difficulty in maintaining theirfriendship, because
it will be impossible for him to content them.
And on well examining the cause of this in the
examples drawn from ancient and modern times

It has been the custom of princes in order to
be able to hold their state securely, to erect for-
