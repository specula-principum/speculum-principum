28 NICCOL0 machiavelli

into hislap, and lay afterwards those foundations
which others make before becoming princes.
With regard to these two methods of becoming

had given him. For, as we have said, he who
does not lay his foundations beforehand may by
great abilities do so afterwards, although with
great trouble to the architect and danger to the
building. If, then, one considers the procedure
of the duke, it will be seen how firm were the
foundations he had laid to his future power,
which I do not think it superfluous to examine,
as I know of no better precepts for a new prince
to follow than may be found in his actions; and

In wishing to aggrandise the duke his son,
Alexander VI had to meet very great difficulties
both present and future. In the first plaqe, he
