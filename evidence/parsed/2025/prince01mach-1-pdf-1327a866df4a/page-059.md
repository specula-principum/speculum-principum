48 NICCOLd MACHIAVELLI
little surrounding country, and obey the em-
peror when they choose, and they do not fear him
or any other potentate that they have about
them. They are fortified in such a manner that
every one thinks that to reduce them would be
tedious and difficult,for they all have the neces-
sary moats and bastions, sufficient artillery, and
always keep food, drink, and fuel for one year in
the public storehouses. Beyond which, to keep
the lower classes satisfied, and without loss to the
commonwealth, they have always enough means
•
to give them work for one year in these employ-
ments which form the nerve and lifeof the town,
and in the industries by which the lower classes
live. Military exercises are still held in high
reputation, and many regulations are in force
for maintaining them.
A prince, therefore, who possesses a strong city
and does not make himself hated, cannot be as-
saulted; and if he were to be so, the assailant
would be obliged to retire shamefully; for so
many things change, that it isalmost impossible
for any one to maintain a siege for a year with
his armies idle. And to those who urge that the
people, having their possessions outside and see-
ing them burnt, will not have patience, and the
long siege and self-interest will make them for-
get their prince, I reply that a powerful and
courageous prince will always overcome those
difficulties by now raising the hopes of his sub-
jects that the evils will not last long, now im-
pressing them with fear of the enemy’s cruelty,
now by dextrously assuring himself of those who
appear too bold. Besides which, the enemy
would naturally burn and ravage the country
