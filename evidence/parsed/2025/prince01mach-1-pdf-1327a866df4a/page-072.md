THE PRINCE 6
Turks into Greece, who after the war would not
go away again, which was the beginning of the
servitude of Greece to the infidels.
And one, therefore, who wishes not to conquer,
would do well to use these forces, which are much
more dangerous than mercenaries, as with them
ruin iscomplete, for they are all united, and owe
obedience to others, whereas with mercenaries,
when they have conquered, itrequires more time
and a good opportunity for them to injure you,
as they do not form a single body and have been
engaged and paid by you, therefore a third party
that you have made leader cannot at once ac-
quire enough authority to be able to injure you.
In a word, the greatest danger with mercenaries
lies in their cowardice and reluctance to fight,
but with auxiliaries the danger lies in their
courage.
A wise prince, therefore, always avoids these
forces and has recourse to his own, and would
prefer rather to lose with his own men than con-
quer with the forces of others, not deeming it a
true victory which is gained by foreign arms. I
never hesitate to cite the example of Cesare Bor-
gia and his actions. This duke entered Romagna
with auxiliary troops, leading forces composed
entirely of French soldiers, and with these he
took Imola and Forli; but as they seemed un-
safe, he had recourse to mercenaries as a less
risky policy, and hired the Orsini and Vitelli.
Afterwards finding these uncertain to handle, un-
faithful, and dangerous, he suppressed them, and
relied upon his own men. And the difference be-
tween these forces can be easily seen if one con-
siders the difference between the reputation of
