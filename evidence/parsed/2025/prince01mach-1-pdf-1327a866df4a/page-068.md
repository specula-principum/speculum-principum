soldier of their enemies they would have had no

him they would have been obliged to obey him.

on land they abandoned this virtue, and began
to follow the Italian custom. And at the com-
mencement of their land conquests they had not
much to fear from their captains, their territories
not being very large, and their reputation being
great, but as their possessions increased, as they
did under Carmagnola, they had an example of
