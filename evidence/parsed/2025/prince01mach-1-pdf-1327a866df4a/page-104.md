CHAPTER XX
WHETHER FORTRESSES AND OTHER THINGS WHICH
PRINCES OFTEN CONTRIVE ARE USEFUL OR INJURIOUS
ome princes, in order to hold their possessions
S securely, have disarmed their citizens, some
others have kept their subj'ect lands divided into
parts, others have fomented enmities against
themselves, others have endeavoured to win over
those whom they suspected at the commence-
ment of their rule: some have constructed fort-
resses, others have cast them down and destroyed
them. And although one cannot pronounce a
definite judgment as to these things without go-
ing into the particulars ofthe state to which such
a deliberation is to be applied, stillI will speak
in such a general way as the matter will permit.
A new prince has never been known to disarm
his subjects, on the contrary, when he has found
them disarmed he has always armed them, for by
arming them these arms become your own, those
that you suspected become faithful and those
that were faithful remain so, and from being
merely subjects become your partisans. And
since all the subjects cannot be armed, when you
give the privilege of arms to some, you can deal
more safely with the others; and this different
treatment that they recognise renders your men
more obliged to you. The others will excuse you,
judging that those have necessarily greater merit
who have greater danger and heavier duties.
But when you disarm them, you commence to
offend them and show that you distrust them
