THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MILITIA AND
MERCENARY SOLDIERS

methods by which many have sought to obtain
such states, itnow remains for me to treat gener-

where there are not good arms, and where there
are good arms there must be good laws, I will
not now discuss the laws, but will speak of the
arms.

cowardly amongst enemies, they have no fear of
God, and keep no faith with men. Ruin isonly
deferred as long as the assault is postponed; in
peace you are despoiled by them, and in war by
