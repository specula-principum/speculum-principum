CHAPTER XXV^
HOW MUCH FORTUNE CAN DO IN HUMAN AFFAIRS
AND HOW IT MAY BE OPPOSED
t isnot unknown to me how many have been
I and are of opinion that worldly events are so
governed by fortune and by God, that men can-
not by their prudence change them, and that on
the contrary there is no remedy whatever, and
for this they may judge it to be useless to toil
much about them, but let things be ruled by
chance. This opinion has been more held in our
day, from the great changes that have been seen,
and are daily seen, beyond every human con-
jecture. When I think about them, at times I am
partly inclined to share thisopinion. Nevertheless,
that our freewill may not be altogether extin-
guished, I think it may be true that fortune isthe
ruler of half our actions, but that she allows the
other half or thereabouts to be governed by us. I
would compare her to an impetuous river that,
when turbulent, inundates the plains, casts down
trees and buildings, removes earth from this side
and places it on the other; every one flees before
it,and everything yields to itsfury without being
able to oppose it; and yet though it isof such a
kind, stillwhen it isquiet, men can make pro-
vision against it by dykes and banks, so that
when itrises it will either go into a canal or its
rush will not be so wild and dangerous. So itis
with fortune, which shows her power where no
measures have been taken to resist her, and di-
rects her fury where she knows that no dykes or
