THE PRINCE 21
comes the ruler of a free city and does not de-
stroy it,can expect to be destroyed by it,for it
can always find a motive for rebellion in the
name of liberty and of its ancient usages, which
are forgotten neither by lapse of time nor by
benefits received; and whatever one does or pro-
vides, so long as the inhabitants are not separ-
ated or dispersed, they do not forget that name
and those usages, but appeal to them at once in
every emergency, as did Pisa after being so many
years held in servitude by the Florentines. But
when citiesor provinces have been accustomed to
live underaprince, and the family of that prince is
extinguished, being on the one hand used to obey,
and on the other not having their old prince, they
cannot unite in choosing one from among them-
selves, and they do not know how to live in free-
dom, so that they are slower to take arms, and a
prince can win them over with greater facility
and establish himself securely. But in republics
there is greater life, greater hatred, and more
desire for vengeance; they do not and cannot
cast aside the memory oftheir ancient liberty, so
that the surest way is either to lay them waste or
reside in them.
