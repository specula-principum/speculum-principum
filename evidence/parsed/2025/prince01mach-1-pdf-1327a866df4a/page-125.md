114 NICCOL0 machiavell
of Naples. On the other hand, he engaged with
him the King of France, because seeing him
make this move and desiring his friendship in
order to put down the Venetians, that king
judged that he could not refuse him his troops
without manifest injury. Thus Julius by his im-
petuous move achieved what no other pontiff
with the utmost human prudence would have
succeeded in doing, because, if he had waited
tillall arrangements had been made and every-
thing settled before leaving Rome, as any other
pontiffwould have done, it would never have suc-
ceeded. For the king ofFrance would have found
a thousand excuses, and the others would have in-
spired him with a thousand fears. I will omit his
other actions, which were all of this kind and
which allsucceeded well, and the shortness ofhis
lifedid not suffer him to experience the contrary,
for had times followed in which it was necessary
to act with caution, his ruin would have resulted,
for he would never have deviated from these
methods to which his nature disposed him.
n I conclude then that fortune varying and men
'remaining fixed in their ways, they are success-
ful so long as these ways conform to circum-
stances, but when they are opposed then they are
(unsuccessful^/! certainly think that itis better
to be impetuous than cautious, for fortune is a
woman, and it isnecessary, ifyou wish to master
her, to conquer her by force; and itcan be seen
that she lets herself be overcome by the bold
rather than by those who proceed coldly. And
therefore, like a woman, she isalways a friend
to the young, because they are less cautious,
fiercer, and master her with greater audacity.
