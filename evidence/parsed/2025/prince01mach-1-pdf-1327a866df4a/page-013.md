2 NICCOL0 MACHIAVELLI
years. I have not sought to adorn my work with
long phrases or high-sounding words or any of
those superficial attractions and ornaments with
which many writers seek to embellish their
material, as I desire no honour for my work
but such as the novelty and gravity of itssubject
mayjustlydeserve. Nor will it,I trust,be deemed
presumptuous on the part of a man of humble
and obscure condition to attempt to discuss and
direct the government ofprinces; for in the same
way that landscape painters station themselves
in the valleys in order to draw mountains or
high ground, and ascend an eminence in order
to get a good view of the plains, so itis necessary
to be a prince to know thoroughly the nature of
the people, and one of the populace to know the
nature of princes.
May I trust, therefore, that Your Highness
will accept this little giftin the spirit in which it
is offered; and if Your Highness will deign to
peruse it, you will recognise in it my ardent
desire that you may attain to that grandeur
which fortune and your own merits presage for
you.
And should Your Highness gaze down from
the summit of your lofty position towards this
humble spot, you will recognise the great and
unmerited sufferings inflicted on me by a cruel
fate.
