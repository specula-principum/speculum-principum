THE PRINCE 49
on first arriving and at the time when men’s
minds are still hot and eager to defend them-
selves, and therefore the prince has still less to
fear, for after some time, when people have
cooled down, the damage is done, the evil has
been suffered, and there is no remedy, so that
they are the more ready to unite with their
prince, as it appears that he is under an obliga-
tion to them, their houses having been burnt
and their possessions ruined in his defence.
It is the nature of men to be as much bound by
the benefits that they confer as by those they re-
ceive. From which it follows that, everything .
considered, a prudent prince will not find it *
'
difficult to uphold the courage of his subjects
both at the commencement and during a state1
of siege, if he possesses provisions and means to •
defend himself. .
