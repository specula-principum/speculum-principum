Appendix E: Federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund
Money
This appendix summarizes the 2025 legislative session’s impact on federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery
Fund money received by the State of Colorado under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Description of fund source
In 2021, Colorado received $3,828,761,790 in federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Funds from the
American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA funds) that were deemed subject to appropriation by the General Assembly.
The General Assembly allocated most of the $3.8 billion in federal ARPA funds during the 2021, 2022 and 2023
legislative sessions in more than 75 bills in six major categories . Of the total, $370.0 million was allocated for
flexible use by the Governor. 17
During the 2024 legislative session, the General Assembly spent the federal funds as quickly as possible to
avoid violating federal deadlines that would have required the funds be returned to the federal government.
Specifically, $1.6 billion that was at risk of being returned was used to pay for personal services in the
Corrections, Human Services, and Judicial Departments in lieu of General Fund. The resulting General Fund
savings was used to continue funding programs that had been supported by federal AR PA funds. Additionally,
$210.6 million of this amount was used to balance the FY 2024 -25 budget. This funding swap was authorized
through H.B. 24 -1466. 18
Summary of 2025 legislative actions
Senate Bill 25 -312 (American Rescue Plan Act Funds) implemented various technical adjustments to the
changes authorized in H.B. 24 -1466. It also included reductions to some programs previously authorized to use
ARPA funds. Major provisions in the bill included:
Net-zero true-ups: Multiple programs spent more federal ARPA funds in FY 2023 -24 than expected. This
required adjustments between federal funds and the General Fund. In most cases, more federal funds (and
less General Fund) was appropriated and spent for programs, and less federal funds (and more General Fund)
was appropriated and spent for personal services. Among other adjustments, the General Assembly
eliminated ARPA funds for employee compensation in the Department of Human Services for FY 2024 -25. This
included a reduction of $63.2 million ARPA funds and an equal i ncrease of $63.2 million General Fund. There
was a similar adjustment for the Department of Corrections. The net fiscal impact of all adjustments was
neutral: $0 for the General Fund and $0 for federal ARPA funds.
Reductions and reversions supporting budget balancing: The bill also changed the funding for some programs
supported by ARPA funds or refinanced ARPA funds. This included adjustments to address the reversion of
funds that had not been spent by statutory deadlines, as well as reductions to some programs. These changes
saved $33.5 million General Fund, which helped the General Assembly balance the FY 2025 -26 budget. Some
