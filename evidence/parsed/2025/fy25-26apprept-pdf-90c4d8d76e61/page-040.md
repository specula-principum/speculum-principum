Additional Information - Total Program Funding
The annual Long Bill contains appropriations based on current law. Thus, for purposes of public school finance,
the Long Bill contains appropriations to fund public schools based on projected student enrollment, the
existing statutory public school finance funding formula, and the minimum constitutionally required increase
in the statewide base per -pupil funding amount.
The General Assembly also passes a separate bill each year that modifies the statutory school finance formula
for the upcoming fisc al year. The annual school finance act always specifies the constitutionally required
increase in the statewide base per -pupil funding amount in statute. Also, the act often includes other
statutory modifications that increase or decrease the cost of funding public schools. If necessary, the act
includes an appropriations clause that increases or decreases appropriations in combination with the Long Bill
for the following fiscal year accordingly.
The FY 2025-26 Long Bill (S.B. 25-206) includes appropriations sufficient to fully fund public schools pursuant
to current law at the time of Long Bill introduction. Other legislation that impacts total program funding in FY
2025-26 includes:
• H.B. 25-1320 (School Finance Act) which sets FY 2025- 26 statutory funding levels for Colorado’s school
districts and makes changes to the implementation of the new school finance formula adopted in House
Bill 24-1448; and
• S.B. 25-315 (Postsecondary & Workforce Readiness Programs) which creates a postsecondary workforce
readiness funding distribution mechanism and repeals or phases -out several related programs.
The following table provides data related to school districts’ total program funding for FY 2024-25 and FY
2025-26. T otal state and local funding for school districts for FY 202 5-26 is $252.7 million (2.6 percent) higher
than FY 2024-25. This level of funding is anticipated to increase average per- pupil funding from $ 11,452 in FY
2024-25 to $11,858 in FY 2025-26 (an increase of $406 per pupil).
