3. Constitutio nal and Statutory Restrictions
Constitutional and statutory restrictions impact Colorado’s annual budget. The constitutional restrictions
affect the amount of revenue that the State may collect and spend while the statutory restrictions set a ceiling
for General Fund appropriations.
Constitutional: Section 20 of Article X (TABOR)
The State Constitution limits the amount of total General Fund and cash fund revenue that the State may
collect and spend. The “Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights,” or "TABOR," requires that State revenue in excess of this
limit be refunded to taxpayers in the following fiscal year, unless the voters approve otherwise. Although the
limit includes General Fund and cash funds, all refunds are paid from the General Fund.
TABOR impacts the state budget in several key ways:
• “State fiscal year spending” is defined as expenditures or reserve increases. In other words, all revenues
received by the State that are not specifically exempt are considered spending.
• The change in state fiscal year spending for the next year is restricted to the percentage change in the
consumer price index (inflation) plus the percentage change in state population in the prior calendar year,
adjusted for revenue changes approved by the voters after 1991.
• The base for calculating the allowable growth is the lesser of either actual revenue or the allowable limit.
Each quarterly revenue forecast includes the calculations for the TABOR limit, the revenue s that are subject to
TABOR, and required refunds for each fiscal year.
Appropriations Exempt from the Constitutional Restriction
The annual budget includes certain appropriations that are exempt from the TABOR revenue limit. Those
appropriations are reflected in the “General Fund Exempt” column in the Long Bill. For FY 2024 -25 and FY
2025-26, that column includes two types of appropriations, both of which are related to voter -approved
measures: (1) Referendum C revenues allocated to the General Fund Exempt Account; and (2) tobacco tax
revenues.
Referendum C: This constitutional provision, approved by the voters in November 2005, allows the State to
retain and spend money in excess of the TABOR limit up to a newly defined "excess state revenue" cap. The
excess state revenue cap is equal to the highest annual total state revenue from FY 2005 -06 through FY 2009-
10, adjusted each subsequent fiscal year for inflation, the percentage change in state population, enterprise
changes, and debt service charges.
Within the General Fund, the measure established the General Fund Exempt Account, which consists of the
amount of state revenue in excess of the limitation on state fiscal year spending that the State would have
refunded had Referendum C not passed. The me asure further established that money in the Account would be
appropriated or transferred to fund four specific uses :
• education, including both pre -school through twelfth grade and higher education, as well as related
capital construction projects;
• health care;
• retirement plans for firefighters and police officers, so long as the General Assembly determines that such
funding is necessary; and
• strategic transportation projects included in the Department of Transportation's strategic transportation
project investment program.
