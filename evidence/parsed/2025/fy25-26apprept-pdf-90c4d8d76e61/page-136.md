Senate Bill 25-206 (Long Bill Supplemental) reduces funding available for property tax reimbursements for

FY 2025-26 Long Bill Highlights
Changes are assumed to be ongoing unless otherwise noted.
Forecast changes for tax exemptions: The bill includes an increase of $5.1 million General Fund for the Senior
Citizen and Disabled Veteran Property Tax Exemption. The money reimburses local governments for property
tax revenue lost due to the state exemption. This is an estimate based on the Office of State Planning and
Budgeting's March forecast.
Forecast changes for HUTF allocations: The bill includes an increase of $1.7 million cash funds from the
Highway Users Tax Fund (HUTF). This reflects changes in the statutory allocations to counties and
municipalities based on revenue projections.
Employee compensation common policies : The bill includes a net increase of $ 630,525 total funds for
employee compensation common policies. For additional information, see Appendix C: Common Policies.
