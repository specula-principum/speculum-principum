Appendix I: State Educatio n Fund
This appendix describes appropriations and transfers from the State Education Fund (SEF).
Revenue and spending
The State Constitution links funding for kindergarten through twelfth grade education to the rate of infl ation
and creates the State Education Fund (SEF). 25 The SEF is funded by a diversion of one -third of one percent of
federal taxable income that would have otherwise gone to the General Fund. The SEF retains any interest
earned on the fund balance.
Revenues to the SEF are not subject to the constitutional Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) limitation on fiscal
year spending. SEF appropriations are not subject to the statutory limitation on state General Fund
appropriations.
The General Assembly may annually appropriate money from the SEF for:
• compliance with the requirements to annually increase base per pupil funding for public school finance
and annually increase funding for categorical programs;
• accountable education reform;
• accountable programs to meet state academic standards;
• class size reduction;
• expanding technology education;
• improving student safety;
• expanding the availability of preschool and kindergarten programs;
• performance incentives for teachers;
• accountability reporting; or
• public school building capital construction.
Appropriations and transfers from the SEF for FY 2025-26 total $1.6 billion (Table 1), with a projected balance
of $606.3 million at the end of FY 2025 -26 (Table 2). Funding related to public school finance and categorical
programs makes up 88.6 percent of all appropriations and transfers from the SEF, the majority of which goes
to the state share of districts’ total program funding.
