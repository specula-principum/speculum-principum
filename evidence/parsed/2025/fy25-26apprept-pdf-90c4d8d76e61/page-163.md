Also included in this line is a 1.5% one-time reduction to the salary base. This reduction was included in the
Health, Life, and Dental line item to give departments maximum flexibility in reducing expenditures on
employee salaries. The expectation is that no employee salaries will actually decrease, with departments
paying for this reduction using reserves.
Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance
Proposition 118 created the Paid Family Medical Leave Insurance program. The program requires employers
and employees in Colorado to pay a payroll premium of 0.9 percent - split evenly between employers and

medical leave. The appropriation for FY 2025-26 is $12,939,384 total funds, including $7,083,123 General
Fund.
PERA Direct Distribution
A line item in each department provides an appropriation for the State's share of the $225.0 million annual
PERA Direct Distribution payment required by statute. The appropriations for the State's share are in
proportion to the Unfunded Liability Amortization Equalization Disbursement Payments described below. The
appropriation for FY 2025-26 is $60,352,598 total funds, including $33,081,977 General Fund.

collective bargaining process. The appropriation for FY 2025- 26 is $80,685,651 total f unds, including
$42,812,933 General Fund.
Shift Differential
Shift differential payments provide higher wages for evening, night, and weekend shifts, except for State

percent of the most recent actual yea r's (FY 2023-24) expenditures. The appropriation for FY 2025 -26 is
$37,948,879 total funds, including $28,616,615 General Fund.

calculated based on 0.07 percent of revised base salary (base salary plus salary increases and shift differential)
for FY 2025-26. There was an incremental decrease in the appropriation for short- term disability for FY 2025-
26 because the State’s insurance provider revised their rates based on the implementation of the Paid Family
