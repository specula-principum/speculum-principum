Appendix K: Informational “(I)” Notations
This appendix summarizes amounts included in the budget for informational purposes only.
Description of fund source
The Long Bill and other legislation indicate when an amount is shown for informational purposes through an
"(I)" notation. As defined in the Long Bill headnotes:
Where the letter "(I)" appears directly to the right of a figure or in a letternote referencing a figure,
that amount is not an appropriation, nor does it limit the expenditure of such money. The figure is
included for informational purposes only. It provides a record of funds anticipated to be expended and,
in some instances, may indicate assumptions used relative to those funds in developing appropriated
amounts.
The amounts annotated with an (I) in the FY 20 25-26 Long Bill and other legislation are described below,
followed by a table detailing these amounts by department and fund source.
General Fund: The (I) notation applies to a General Fund or General Fund Exempt amount when the amount is
continuously appropriated to a state agency, or the agency is otherwise authorized by law to spend the
money. Continuously appropriated amounts do not require additional authorization from the General
Assembly to be spent. This includes General Fund amounts annotated with the (I) in three departments:
• Treasury: Senior Citizen and Disabled Vet eran Property Tax Exemption and Direct Distribution for
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued PERA Liability;
• Revenue: Old Age Heat and Fuel and Property Tax Assistance, Cigarette Tax Rebate; Retail Marijuana Sales
Tax Distributions to Local Governments; and
• Local Affairs: Payments for Volunteer Firefighter Retirement Plans and Death and Disability Insurance.
Cash Funds: The (I) notation applies to a cash funds amount when the amount is continuously appropriated to
a state agency, or the agency is otherwise authorized by law to spend the money. The most significant
amounts that are annotated with the (I) include:
• Cash funds overseen by the State Transportation Commission;
• Highway Users Tax Funds distributed to local governments through the Department of Treasury;
• Fees collected by state institutions of higher education;
• Old Age Pension allocations and the local share of funding for various social services programs in the
Department of Human Services; and
• Local Government Mineral and Energy Impact grants and disbursements and money from the Affordable
Housing Support Fund in the Department of Local Affairs.
Reappropriated Funds: The (I) notation applies to a reappropriated funds amount when it is continuously
appropriated to a state agency, the agency is otherwise authorized by law to spend the money, or when the
underlying federal funds source is informational. The largest amount that is annotated with the (I) is for
workers’ compensation claims in the Department of Personnel.
Federal Funds: Most federal funds in the Long Bill are annotated with an (I). However, some federal grants
that are administered by the Departments of Human Services and Public Health and Environment are
appropriated by the General Assembly pursuant to federal law. In addition, there are federal funds that
