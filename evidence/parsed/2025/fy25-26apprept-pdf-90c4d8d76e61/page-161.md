appropriations related to capital construction projects and information technology projects included in the
Long Bill.
Reappropriated Funds
Reappropriated funds are amounts of General Fund, cash funds, or federal funds that are appropriated more
than one time in the same fiscal year. They therefore represent a double -count of funding. For example,
$100,000 General Fund is appropriated to the Department of Education for legal services provided by the
Department of Law. The same amount is reappropriated to the Department of Law to provide such services.
The appropriation to the Department of Law is identified as reappropriated funds with an associated letter
note identifying the origin of the funds. The total appropriation for those legal services appears to be
$200,000 due to the doubl e-count, but the actual cost to the State is $100,000 General Fund.
Roll-forward Spending Authority
Most appropriations are only valid for one fiscal year. Roll- forward spending authority allows a state agency to
spend an appropriation over multiple fiscal years. For example, an appropriation for FY 2024 -25 with one-year
of roll-forward spending authority may be spent in FY 2025 -26. Roll-forward authority may be limited to a
portion of the appropriation, such as unexpended amounts at the end of a fiscal year. The timeframe for
spending may also be limited to a portion of a fiscal year.
Supplemental Appropriation
A supplemental appropriation is provided through l egislation which authorizes changes in appropriations for
the current fiscal year or a previous fiscal year.
