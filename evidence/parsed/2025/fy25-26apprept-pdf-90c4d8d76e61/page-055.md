Total -$8,718 -$4,359 $0 $0 -$4,359 1.0
Prior year actions: The bill includes adjustments for out- year impacts of prior year legislation and budget
actions. In the table below, the titles of the annualizations begin with either a bill number or the relevant fiscal
year.
The largest increases include:
• FY 23-24 Community-based access to services primarily for the expected increase in utilization when long -
term services and supports become available through the state plan, rather than through waivers with
defined eligibility criteria. The General Fund increase is more than offset by an increase in the federal
match. See the Community First Choice adjustment for the change in the federal match.
• HB 22-1289 Health benefits children & pregnant people lacking access due to immigration status primarily
for the service costs associated with the new eligibility.
• FY 24-25 R6 Provider rates for provider rate increases approved last year. The legislature used one -time
funding to pay part of the increase for Home - and Community-Based Services, explaining the large
increase in General Fund and decrease in cash funds.
The largest decreases include:
• FY 24-25 Public health emergency unwind primarily for the phase-out of extra eligibility determination
supports provided during the unwind.
• HB 23-1228 Nursing facility rates for a step down in the statutory nursing provider rate increases.
• HB 24-1401 Denver Health funding for the end of one -time funding provided to support Denver Health
