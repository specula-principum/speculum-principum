Department of Health Care Policy and Financing
The Department helps pay health and long -term care costs for low-income and vulnerable people. Federal
matching funds assist with these costs. In return for the federal funds, the Department must follow federal
rules for program eligibility, benefits, and other features. Major programs administered by the Department
include:
• Medicaid – serves people with low income and people needing long -term care
• Children's Basic Health Plan – provides low-cost insurance for children and pregnant women with income
slightly higher than Medicaid allows
• Old Age Pension Health and Medical Program – serves elderly people with low income who qualify for a
state pension but do not qualify for Medicaid or Medicare
The Department also performs functions related to improving the health care delivery system. It advises the
General Assembly and the Governor, administers grants such as the Primary Care and Preventive Care Grant
Program, and housing the Commission on Family Medicine Residency Training Programs.
