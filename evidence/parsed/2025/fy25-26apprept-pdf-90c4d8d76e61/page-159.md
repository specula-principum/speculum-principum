Appendix B: Glossary of Terms
Legislative Appropriation
The State Constitution provides the General Assembly with the power of appropriation. An appropriation
provides the legal authority for a department to spend a specified sum of money for a specified purpose for a
specified period, usually one state fiscal year. A state department may only expend money from the State
treasury if the agency has a legislative appropriation for such purpose or if the expenditure is otherwise
authorized by law.
Continuous Appropriation
Continuous appropriation authority allows state agencies to spend money for specified purposes without
further appropriation by the General Assembly. It often allows agencies to spend an amount of money over
multiple fiscal years without requiring legislative approval on an annual basis. This authority is often statutory
and usually applies to cash funds or subaccounts within cash funds. It sometimes applies to reappropriated
funds.
Capital Construction Fund
The Capital Construction Fund is a fund that receives transfers from the General Fund or other funds for
capital construction projects. Money in this fund is appropriated to: construct, repair, and renovate state
facilities; purchase major equipment; and acquire land . Appropriations from this fund are exempt from the
fiscal year spending limit imposed by Section 20 of Article X of the State Constitution (also known as the
Taxpayer's Bill of Rights or TABOR), because they authorize expenditures from a reserv e.
Cash Funds
Cash funds are s pecific funds created to receive earmarked revenue. This revenue is often collected from users
of services or programs as fees but may also include specific taxes or fines. These funds typically pay for the
programs for which the revenues are collected.
Common Policies
Common policies apply to all departments unless specifically exempted. For example, there is a common policy
for the rates agencies pay to the Department of Personnel for vehicle leases. There is also a common policy for
payments to the Governor's Office of Information Technology for information technology -related services.
C.R.S.
The Colorado Revised Statutes, which are the compilation of Colorado laws.
Federal Funds
Federal funds are funds from the federal government. Some federal funds are grants for limited purposes, while
other federal funds support ongoing programs and may require matching S tate funds . Examples of programs
requiring a S tate match are Medicaid and highway construction. Federal funds are exempt from the fiscal year
spending limit imposed by TABOR and are typically included in the Long Bill for informational purposes only.
