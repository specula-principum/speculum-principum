ADC Case cost and caseload increase: The bill includes an increase of $7.0 million General Fund for the
Alternate Defense Counsel (ADC). This aims to support increasing caseload stemming from cases where t he
Public Defenders’ Office is barred from representing defendants due to conflicts of interest. Funding also
supports higher costs-per-case for the ADC’s contractor-attorneys.
Carr Judicial Center leased space: The bill includes a net increase of $3.2 million reappropriated funds to State
Courts Administration for budget- neutral lease space allocations. The reappropriated funds originate as
General Fund appropriated to the State Courts, the State Public Defende r, and the Office of Administrative
Services for Independent Agencies. Allocations for each division reflect a lease rate of $17.48 per square foot
to the leased space cost paid by the Department of Law for the Carr Judicia l Center. The $3.2 million General
Fund appropriated to the divisions is offset by a reduction to General Fund support of the Carr Judicial Center
operating budget.
SC Virtual court management system : The bill includes $3.0 million from the Judicial IT Cash Fund to
implement the virtual court management system. This system aims to ensure order and public safety in virtual
courtroom processes. It does this by increasing the Courts' control over participation in virtual hearings. The
appropriation is the second year of funding for this system.
SC Language interpreters and translators : The bill includes $2.2 million General Fund for increased contract
language services for the State Courts. This General Fund appropriation is offset by an equal reduction of
General Fund and an increase from the Judicial Stabilization Cash Fund for Trial Court Programs.
Operating common policies: The bill includes a net increase of $1.8 million for operating common policies. For
additional information, see Appendix C: Common Policies.
