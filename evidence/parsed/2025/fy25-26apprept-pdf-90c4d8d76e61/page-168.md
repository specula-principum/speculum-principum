Appendix D: General Fund Exempt
This appendix provides information concerning General Fund amounts that are described or categorized in this
report as “exempt” from constitutional and statutory restrictions.
Appropriatio ns Exempt from the Constitutional Restriction
Items that appear in the "General Fund Exempt" column are exempt from the state fiscal year spending limit
in Section 20 of Article X of the State Constitution (the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights or TABOR). There are two types
of appropriations in FY 2024 -25 and FY 2025- 26 that are categorized as General Fund Exempt, both of which
are related to voter approved measures.
• Appropriations from the General Fund Exempt Account: Referendum C was referred to and passed by
voters in November 2005. It authorizes the State to retain and spend state revenues in excess of the
TABOR state fiscal year spending limit but less than the excess state revenues cap. This measure also
established the General Fund Exempt Account, which consists of the amount of sta te revenues in excess
of the TABOR state fiscal year spending limit that would have been refunded had Referendum C not
passed. Money in the General Fund Exempt Account may only be appropriated or transferred to serve
four purposes: health care; education; retirement plans for firefighters and police officers; and strategic
transportation projects. For more information about Referendum C, see Constitutional and Statutory
Restrictions the General Fund Overview in Part I of this report .
• Appropriations from Tobacco Tax Revenues: Amendment 35, which was approved by voters in
November 2004, imposed new cigarette and tobacco taxes through the addition of Section 21 in Article X
of the State Constitution. The new tobacco tax revenues authorized by Amendment 35 are exempt from
the TABOR state fiscal year spending limit, and General Fund appropriations from these revenues are also
exempt from the statutory restriction on General Fund appropriations (this exemption is discussed later in
this section). Amendment 35 requires that a portion of the new tobacco tax revenues be appropriated to
the General Fund and made available to the Department of Public Health and Environment for
immunization services and to the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing for the Children's Basic
Health Plan. For more information about Amendment 35, see Appendix J.
