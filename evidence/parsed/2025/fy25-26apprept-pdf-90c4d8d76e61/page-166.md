This line item provides funding to pay for information technology services provided by the Governor’s Office of
Information Technology (OIT). The Long Bill includes costs of $286.7 million total funds, including $139.7
million General Fund. The total appropriation includes a base reduction of 5 percent for noncritical agencies,
which reduced appropriations statewide by $3.7 million total funds and $1.5 million General Fund. This
compares to $283.6 million total funds, including $139.0 million General Fund, for FY 2024- 25.
Risk Management and Property Funds
This line item provides funding for each department's share of the statewide cost of property and liability
insurance coverage based on a three-year average loss history as verified by an independent actuarial firm.
The Department of Personnel has continuo us spending authority for the property and liability program claims,
premiums, and legal expenses, but not for administrative costs.
Indirect Costs
Indirect costs are the overhead costs associated with the operation of general government functions and
departmental administrative duties. Indirect cost recoveries are intended to offset the costs of providing
central services for cash-funded and federall y-funded programs that would otherwise be supported by
General Fund. In practice, each cash funded or federal funded program in a department is charged a
proportional indirect cost assessment that includes statewide and departmental indirect costs. These i ndirect
cost recoveries are used to offset General Fund appropriations in each department's Executive Director's
office.
Vehicle Lease Payments
Pursuant to statute, state agency motor vehicles may only be purchased through the Fleet Management
Program administered by the Department of Personnel. Long Bill appropriations are based on the amount
necessary for each department's vehicle lease payments, which vary according to the number, models, and
types of leased vehicles. For FY 2025-26, the bill includes funding for 552 vehicles, consisting of 470 alternative
fuel vehicles and 82 standard vehicles. Fiscal year 2024-25 appropriations supported the r eplacement of 725
vehicles, consisting of 534 alternative fuel vehicles and 191 standard vehicles.
Workers' Compensation
This line item provides funding for each department's share of the statewide cost of workers' compensation
coverage, based on a three-year average loss history as verified by an independent actuarial firm. The State is
self-insured and provides coverage for employees in all departments except for institutions of higher
education, which operate separate self -insured programs.
