excludes rates that are adjusted annually or periodically based on a federal or state statute or regulation
where the adjustment is included in the forecast.
• CU School of Medicine – An increase of $9.2 million total funds for reimbursements for Medicaid services
provided by the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The source of the state match is
reappropriated funds transferred by the Department of Highe r Education from the General Fund for the
School of Medicine.
• Community First Choice rate rebalance – A net increase of $256,524 total funds, including $112,871
General Fund, to rebalance rates for long-term services and supports to implement Community First
Choice. Under Community First Choice, select long-term services and supports move from federal waivers
that serve defined populations to the State Plan that serves all members. The Department must pay the
same rates for the same services regardless of the population served. The Department selected new rates
with the goal of keeping aggregate costs the same. Some rates will increase and some will decrease.
States that implement Community First Choice receive an additional federal match of six percentage
points for the services.
• Non-emergent medical transportation – A net decrease of $45.7 million total funds, including $13.7
million General Fund, to the mileage rate component of non -emergency medical transportation. Non-
ambulance mileage rates would decrease from $6.10 to $3.00 per mile and wheelchair vehicle mileage
rates would increase from $1.19 to $3.00 per mile. These rates compare to $2.80 per mile for large
market taxi carriers regulated by the Public Utilities Commission.
• Pharmacy reimbursement – A reduction of $2.1 million total funds, including $470,433 General Fund, for
drugs with no acquisition cost data . Medicaid pays for pharmaceuticals at cost, but when there is
insufficient data to determine the average acquisition cost, such as when a drug is new and/or low
volume, the Department indexes the rates to a measure of wholesale costs and applies a discoun t. The
measure of wholesale costs overstates average acquisition costs but the amount varies by drug. This
change increases the discount applied to wholesale costs for this small subset of drugs. The change
primarily impacts mail order pharmacies.
• Alternative Care Facilities rates – A reduction of $0.7 million total funds, including $0.4 million General
Fund, from a tiered rate structure for services offered in Alternative Care Facilities, which are certified
assisted living residences that offer el ders and persons with disabilities health services in a community
setting.
• Group respite rate – A reduction of $176 total funds, including $88 General Fund, for adjustments to the
group respite rate for the Children’s Habilitation Residential Program waiver.
County eligibility administration: The bill increases compensation to counties for eligibility determinations
and administration of medical assistance programs. The changes cost $21.0 million total funds, including $2.6
million General Fund.
CO Benefits Management System: The bill provides funding for upgrades to the Colorado Benefits
Management system, including: replacing current data syncing technology and implementing advanced
monitoring, automating user acceptance testing of software, expanding the use of integrated c haracter
recognition, and adding interactive voice recognition for client self-service. The changes cost $10.1 million
total funds, including $0.5 million General Fund, and 0.9 FTE. Additional costs for this development are
detailed in the Department of Human Services.
Transfers to other state agencies: The bill includes a net increase for programs that are financed with
Medicaid funds but operated by other departments. The changes cost $5. 8 million total funds, including $6.3
million General Fund.
