FTE
Full- time equivalent (FTE) means the budgetary equivalent of one permanent position continuously filled full-
time for an entire fiscal year by elected officials or by state employees who are paid for at least 2,080 hours .
For example, two employees in two different positions whose combined hours equal 2,080 for a fiscal year
equal 1.0 FTE.
General Fund
The General Fund consists of general tax revenues, such as state sales and income tax revenues, as well as any
other revenues and money not legally required to be credited to a specific fund. This fund is used to pay for a
variety of state programs and services that are considered to be general government services that should be
provided for the state and its citizens generally rather than paid for by individual users of services whose fees
pay for a specific service. General Fund revenue and expenditures a re restricted by both TABOR and a
statutory provision that restricts annual state General Fund appropriations to an amount equal to 5.0 percent
of Colorado personal income.
Informational Funds
The Long Bill and other legislation indicate when an amount is shown for informational purposes with an "(I)"
notation. As defined in the Long Bill headnotes, these amounts do not reflect appropriations made by the
General Assembly, nor do they limit the expenditure of such money. For more information, see Appendix K.
Information Technology Capital Account within the Capital Construction Fund
The Information Technology Capital Account within the Capital Construction Fund is a fund that receives
transfers from the General Fund or other funds for information technology projects. Appropriations from this
fund are exempt from the fiscal year spending limit imposed by Section 20 of Article X of the State
Constitution (TABOR) because they authorize expenditures from a reserve .
Indirect Costs
Indirect costs are the administrative costs associated with the operation of general state government
functions . They aim to offset the costs of providing central services for cash- funded and federally-funded
programs that would otherwise be supported by the General Fund.
Indirect costs are difficult to calculate, price, and bill fairly and efficiently. They are therefore calculated
proportionally by division or program based on FTE, appropriation amount, historical cost, or as a set
percentage of actual program cost.
Long Bill
The annual Long Bill provides most of the appropriations for the expenses of the State’s executive, legislative,
and judicial departments . Most of these appropriations apply to the state fiscal year beginning on July 1.
However, the bill often includes additional sections amending existing appropriations for the current or prior
state fiscal years. These sections are often referred to as “Long Bill supplementals” or “Long Bill add -ons.”
Operating Budget
This term refers to the sum of appropriations in the Long Bill and other bills that support the ordinary, ongoing
operating expenses of executive, legislative, and judicial departments. The operating budget excludes
