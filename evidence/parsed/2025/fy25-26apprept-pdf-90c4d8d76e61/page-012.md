1 Beginning in FY 2025-26, the General Assembly deemed $164.6 million in General Fund appropriations for PERA Direct Distribution as exempt
from the statutory reserve requirement. That amount is now classified as a rebate and expenditure in the quarterly revenue forecasts and is the
major factor in the change in rebates and expenditures from FY 2024-25 to FY 2025-26.
Please note that Part II of this document explains m ajor changes in Long Bill appropriations for each
department. Appendix A includes summary tables of appropriations by bill. Appendix C summarizes budget
actions that affected all departments , which are called “common policies.”
Other Obligations
The General Assembly also adopted bills affecting General Fund obligations in other ways. These statutory
changes fall into two basic categories: bills that impact transfers out of the General Fund to other funds and
bills that impact the TABOR refund obligation.
Transfers
Tables 3B and 3C identify all 2025 regular session bills that transferred money out of the General Fund to
other funds. Table 3 B focuses on infrastructure - and capital-related transfers. Table 3C includes bills
impacting all other transfers from the General Fund to other funds . In these tables, positive numbers indicate
increased transfers from the General Fund and negative numbers indicate reductions to transfers that would
have taken place under previous statute.
