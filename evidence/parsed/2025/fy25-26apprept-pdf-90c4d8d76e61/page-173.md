Appendix F: Highway Users Tax Fund “Off -the -Top”
The Highway Users Tax Fund (HUTF) receives revenue from gasoline and special- fuel taxes; traffic fines; license
plate and driver’s license fees; motor vehicle title and registration fees; and passenger -mile taxes. The
Colorado Constitution limits expenditures from gas taxes and license and registration fees exclusively to the
construction, maintenance, and supervision of state highways. 19 Appropriations from the HUTF are
determined annually using an “off the top” appropriation for supervision before a formulaic allocation to
cities, counties, and the State Highway Fund.
The HUTF "off-the-top" refers to the portion of the fund appropriated to the Department of Public Safety for
supervision of highways. Statute limits the annual growth of HUTF off- the-top appropriations to no more than
6.0 percent of the previous fiscal year, regardless of any increase or decrease in overall highway -related
revenues. 20
