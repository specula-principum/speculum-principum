The General Assembly includes footnotes in the annual Long Bill to: (a) set forth purposes, conditions, or
limitations on an item of appropriation; (b) explain assumptions used in determining a specific amount of an
appropriation; or (c) express legislative intent relating to any appropriation. Footnotes to the 202 5 Long Bill
