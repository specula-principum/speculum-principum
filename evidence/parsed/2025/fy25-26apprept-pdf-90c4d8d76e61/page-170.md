Section 1 – Rebates and Expenditures
The quarterly revenue forecasts prepared by the Legislative Council Staff and the Office of State Planning and
Budgeting include dollar amounts referred to as "rebates and expenditures." These amounts reflect various
expenditures or diversions of funds from the General Fund that are exempt from or are not subject to the
statutory restriction on General Fund appropriations pursuant to statutory or constitutional provisions. T h e se
statutory and constitutional obligations are listed below. Note that some rebates and expenditures are not
reflected in General Fund appropriations, and the amounts that are reflected in General Fund appropriations
are not routinely adjusted to reflect changes in the quarterly revenue forecasts. To develop and adjust the
overall General Fund budget, the most recent projected amounts are used rather than appropriated amounts.
The above table reflects the appropriated amounts for rebates and expenditures .
Items that are included in annual General Fund appropriations include:
• fire and police pension payments for local governments [Section 31-30-1112 (2), C.R.S.];
• cigarette tax rebates to local governments [Section 39 -22-623 (1)(a)(II)(A), C.R.S.];
• retail marijuana sales tax distributions to local governments [Section 39 -28.8-203 (1)(a), C.R.S.];
• Old Age Heat and Fuel and Property Tax Assistance Grants [Section 39-31-102 (1), C.R.S.];
• certain tobacco tax revenues [Section 21 of Article X of the State Constitution, often referred to as
"Amendment 35"];
• business personal property tax exemption [Section 39 -3-119.5 (3)(e), C.R.S.]; and
• the General Fund portion of PERA direct distribution payments reflected in the Department of Treasury.
As the PERA direct distribution payment is made through a warrant, it was added to the list of rebates and
expenditures for the FY 2025 -26 appropriation. In prior years, forecasts had assumed that it was subject
to the restriction.
The quarterly revenue forecasts include an additional subset of rebates and expenditures items that are not
included in annual General Fund appropriations (and are therefore not reflected in the table above), including:
• sales and use taxes that are credited to the Old Age Pension Fund [Article XXIV of the State Constitution
and Section 39 -26-123 (3), C.R.S.];
• sales and use taxes that are credited to the Older Coloradans Cash Fund [Section 39-26-123 (3), C.R.S.];
• earnings related to cash flow loans to school districts [Sections 22 -54- 110 and 29- 15- 112, C.R.S.].
Section 2 – Senior and Disabled Veteran Property Tax Homestead
Exemption
In 2000, Colorado voters approved a constitutional amendment (Section 3.5 of Article X) that reduces property
taxes for qualifying senior citizens and disabled veterans. The property tax reduction, or "homestead
exemption," is available to senior citizens 65 years of age or older who have owned and lived in their homes
for at least ten years. In the 2006 general election, Colorado voters approved a constitutional amendment
extending the homestead exemption to honorably discharged veterans who are 100 percent disabled as a
result of a service-connected disability. The cost of the exemption is borne by the State rather than by local
governments or other property owners.
