Appendix G: Marijuana Tax Cash Fund
This appendix summarizes the 2025 legislative session’s impact on the Marijuana Tax Cash Fund.
Description of fund source
The Marijuana Tax Cash Fund (MTCF) is comprised of: (a) all revenues collected from the regular state sales tax
on medical marijuana and non-marijuana retail product sales, and (b) a portion of the special sales tax revenue
generated from retail marijuana sales. The General Assembly has defined specific purposes for which funds
from the MTCF may be appropriated. 21
Long Bill appropriations for FY 2025-26 are based on revenue forecasts from the Governor’s Office of State
Planning and Budgeting (OSPB). For more information about marijuana revenue, please refer to the FY 2025-
26 Marijuana Tax Cash Fund Figure Setting document.
Summary of 2025 legislative actions
The General Assembly allocated or transferred a total of $128.5 million from the MTCF for FY 2025 -26. This
includes $124.7 million in appropriations to fifteen departments and $3.8 million in statutory transfers. Due to
ongoing market challenges and declining revenues, the General Assembly reduced FY 2025 -26 appropriations
by approximately $19.0 million compared to FY 2024 -25.
Additionally, S.B. 25-268 (Changes to Money in the Marijuana Tax Cash Fund) implemented several statutory
changes to balance the MTCF in FY 2025-26. One significant change was the cancellation of the planned $20
million transfer to the Public School Capital Construction Assistance Fund. This fund supports the Building
Excellent Schools Today (BEST) program in the Department of Education. The bill also revised the distribution
of marijuana tax revenue, increasing the state's share while decreasing the amount allocated to local
governments.
