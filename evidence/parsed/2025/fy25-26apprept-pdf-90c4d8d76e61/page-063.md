CCCS Concurrent enrollment support: The bill eliminates $105,000 General Fund and an equal amount of
reappropriated funds at the Colorado Community College System (CCCS) that supports concu rrent enrollment
efforts. This is a budget balancing measure. CCCS is expected to absorb the related costs within existing
resources.

Colorado State University (CSU) Food Systems Advisory Council as a budget balancing measure. This includes a

Council’s last year under current statute.
Prior year actions: The bill includes a net decrease of $37.1 million for the FY 2025-26 impact of prior year
