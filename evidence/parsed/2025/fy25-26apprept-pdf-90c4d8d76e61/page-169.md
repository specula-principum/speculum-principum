Appropriatio ns Exempt from the Statutory Restriction
Statute restricts annual state General Fund appropriations to an amount equal to 5.0 percent of Colorado
personal income plus certain property tax reappraisal costs. 14 Statute also specifies that this restriction on
General Fund appropriations shall not apply to 15:
• Any General Fund appropriation that, as a result of any requirement of federal law, is made for any new
program or service or for any increase in the level of service for an existing program beyond the existing
level of service;
• Any General Fund appropriation that, as a result of any requirement of a final state or federal court order,
is made for any new program or service or for any increase in the level of service for an existing program
beyond the existing level of service; or
• Any General Fund appropriation of any revenue derived from any increase in the rate or amount of any
tax or fee that is approved by a majority of the registered electors of the state voting at any general
election.
Additionally, certain General Fund transfers and appropriations are not subject to the statutory restriction for
reasons other than the exceptions listed above. For example, General Fund transfers to the Capital
Construction Fund are not subject to the statutory restriction 16; and the General Fund appropriation related to
the senior citizen and disabled veteran property tax exemption is not subject to the statutory restriction
because the enactment of Section 3.5 (3) of Article X of the Colorado Constitution constitutes voter approval
weakening the restriction. These other exceptions are noted in the relevant department sections of this
report.
The following table lists the General Fund appropriations that are exempt from or are not subject to the
statutory restriction on General Fund appropriations for FY 20 24-25 and FY 2025- 26. These amounts are
organized into three sections, which are described following the table.
