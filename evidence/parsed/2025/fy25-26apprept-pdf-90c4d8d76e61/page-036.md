Healthy School Meals for All : The Long Bill includes an increase of $42.2 million General Fund to cover the
$151.0 million cost of free school meals for all public school students after accounting for federal support. T he
General Fund increase was consistent with current law at the time of Long Bill introduction. However, S.B. 25-
214 (Healthy School Meals for All Program) modified the program and reversed this action, reducing the Long

State Education Fund for the program.
CSI Mill levy equalization: The bill includes an increase of $6.2 million cash funds from the State Education
Fund for mill levy equalization for Charter School Institute (CSI) charter schools. This brings support for this
program to $54.6 million, including $27.2 from the General Fund and $2 7.4 million from the State Education
Fund. The program guarantees that students enrolled at CSI schools receive per pupil mill levy override
funding equal to the district per pupil mill levy override funding in each dis trict where a CSI school is located.
READ Act training support: The bill includes a one-time increase of $3.4 million from the Early Literacy Cash
