What’s New
JBC Staff made a number of changes to the FY 2025 -26 Appropriations Report in an effort to : (1) focus on the
actions taken in the 2025 legislative session and , (2) remove information that is duplicated elsewhere. This
section notes significant changes to this year’s Report, as compared to previous Reports.
Focus on the 2025 legislative session
Previous versions of the Appropriations Report included historical information about appropriations, state
agencies, specific fund sources, and funding formulas, sometimes spanning multiple decades. Much of this
historical information has been removed from this Report, which focuses on summarizing the fiscal impact of
the 2025 legislative session.
Readers who are interested in historical information should consult the Ten Y ear Appropriations History
(https://leg.colorado.gov/publications/2024-appropriations-history-report-fy-2015-16-through- fy-2024- 25)
and JBC staff briefing and figure setting documents (https://leg.colorado.gov/content/budget) . An updated
version of the Ten Year Appropriations History will be available on the legislative website in October 2025.
Division-level detail not included in thisReport
Previous versions of the Report included descriptions and tables for every division of every state agency. This
information is not included in this Report but can be available as needed. Readers who desire this information
should contact Craig Harper (craig.harper@coleg.gov), Justin Brakke (justin.brakke@coleg.gov), and the
relevant analyst for the department of interest.
Descriptions of recent legislation not included in this Report
Previous versions of the Report included an appendix that described every bill passed in the most recent
legislative session and their fiscal impact. T hat information can be found on the General Assembly’s website
(https://leg.colorado.gov/bill- search) through both Final Fiscal Notes for each bill and the annual Digest of Bills
and has been removed from this Report. However, t his Report includes an appendix with two tables showing
appropriations by bill for FY 2024-25 and FY 2025- 26.
Requests for Information not includedin this Report
Previous versions of the Report included an appendix showing legislative Requests for Information, often
referred to as “RFIs.” R equests for I nformation can be found on the Joint Budget Committee website:
https://leg.colorado.gov/content/budget.

Previous versions of the Report included detailed information about some departments. This detailed
information may now be provided through separate documents published on the Joint Budget Committee
Staff website.
