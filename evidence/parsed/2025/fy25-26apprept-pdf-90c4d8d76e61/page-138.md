Capital Construction
This section discusses funding appropriated to state departments and higher education institutions for capital construction and controlled
maintenance. Transfers from the General Fund to the Capital Construction Fund (CCF) provide the funding for most projects. The Capital
Development Committee reviews all capital requests and provides funding recommendations to the Joint Budget Committee. Capital construction
appropriations remain available for three fiscal years without further appropriation.
