• In Demand Short-term Credentials: The bill includes a reduction of $30.0 General Fund in FY 2023 -24 and
a related increase of $30.0 million General Fund in FY 2024 -25. The FY 2023-24 change reflects money
that was appropriated in H.B. 23-1246 (In Demand Short-term Credentials) and reverted at the end of FY
2023-24. This money should have rolled forward for use in subsequent years but did not due to a
technical error by the Department. To ensure that spending may continue as the General Assembly
intended, the $30.0 million that reverted at the end of FY 2023 -24 is appropriated again in FY 2024-25.
• Tuition: The bill includes an increase of $53.1 million cash funds for adjustments to the forecast for
institutional tuition revenue. Total FY 2024 -25 tuition revenue for the ten state governing boards is
projected to be $2.8 billion.
• Fees: The bill includes an increase of $21.0 million cash funds for adjustments to the forecast for fee
revenue paid by students. Total FY 2024-25 mandatory fee revenue for the ten state governing boards is
projected to be $282.0 million. Mandatory fees are fees that all students pay regardless of their course of
study. They are shown in the Long Bill for informational purposes only.
• Financial Aid and COF adjustments: The bill includes adjustments to the amounts for the College
Opportunity Fund (COF) stipend for students attending private institutions, Need Based Grants, and
financial aid programs for students who were in foster care or homeless while in high schools. The
combined impact of these adjustments is $0.
• Educator stipends: The bill includes a reduction of $920,000 for educator stipends based on the
anticipated underexpenditure of these funds. The funds originate as State Education Fund money in the
Department of Education.
FY 2025-26 Long Bill Highlights
Changes are assumed to be ongoing unless otherwise noted.
State funding and tuition for higher ed:
General Fund: The bill includes an increase of $39.0 million (2.5 percent) for the higher education institutions
and aligned financial aid. This includes an increase of $31.7 million for the higher education institutions and
$7.3 million for financial aid. Support for the state governing boards is reappropriated (double- counted) in the
appropriation.
The State allocation for the institutions uses the performance funding component of the formula established
by H.B. 20-1366 ( Higher Education Funding Allocation Model). This portion of the model compares institutions'
performance changes over time with the performance changes of other institutions in eight areas: resident
FTE enrollment, credential production, Pell eligible enrollment, underrepresented minority enrollment,
retention rate, graduation rate in 100.0 percent of time, graduation rate in 150.0 percent of time, and first
generation enrollment. Both base funding and the 2.5 percent increase are allocated through this part of the
model, but the result changes each institution’s funding only slightly. This year, each institution receives its
prior year base plus an increase of 2.0 percent to 3.4 percent, based on its performance model outcome. The
local district colleges, the area technical colleges, and specialty education programs at the University of
Colorado and Colorado State University, such as the medical and veterinary schools, receiv e the average
increase of 2.5 percent.
The appropriation sets the College Opportunity Fund (COF) stipend at $116 per credit hour or $3,480 per year
for a full time, full year (30 credit hour) student, which is the same as FY 2024 -25. The balance of funding for
the state institutions is provided through fee-for-service contracts.
The $7.3 million financial aid increase is applied to the Need Based Grants line item.
