Department of Revenue
The Department of Revenue is organized into three functional groups: Taxation Business Group, Division of
Motor Vehicles, and The Specialized Business Group. The Taxation Business Group collects tax and other
revenue for the state and for many local governments and assists taxpayers in tax related matters. The
Division of Motor Vehicles regulates and licenses drivers, issues personal identification documents, oversees
vehicle inspection stations, and registers and titles vehicles. The Specialized Business Group regulates alcohol,
tobacco, marijuana, horseracing, off-track betting, limited gaming, sports betting, and motor vehicle dealers
and sales persons. The Department also operates the State Lottery, a TABOR enterprise supported by lottery
ticket sales.
