• The current vendor for the nursing preadmission screenings and resident reviews is not completing the
evaluations in the federally required 7-9 days and lacks capacity to monitor needs for specialized services,
such as behavioral health. The increase will allow for higher contract standards.
• Statutes require the Department to conduct the nursing facility appraisals every four years.
• The Department needs audits of cost reports to comply with state statutes and federal regulations and
has no control over the market rates for the service.
• The lack of funding in H.B. 22 -1289 for on-going actuarial analysis for rate setting was an oversight in the
Fiscal Note.
County escalation resolution unit: The bill includes funding for staff to update member eligibility information
in the Colorado Benefits Management System, for contract resources to manage the complaints and
grievances tracking system, and to purchase software licenses for all counties and case management agencies
for access to the tracking system. The changes cost $0.7 million total funds, including $0.2 million General
Fund, and 1.8 FTE.
All-Payer Claims Database: The bill includes a net increase for the All- Payer Claims Database (APCD). The
change also saves $929,943 General Fund. The funding assumes that the APCD eliminates all non- essential
reports and the $500,000 General Fund scholarship program that helps researchers access the database. Also,
it refinances some of the cost with matching federal funds and the Healthcare Affordability and Sustainability
(HAS) Fee, in proportion to the activities attributable to those fund sources. Fina lly, it includes an increase for
information technology security upgrades.
Equity Office realignment: The bill includes a shift in costs from the Colorado Equity Office in the Department
of Personnel to this department. This department received an increase of $74,921 General Fund, but there is a
corresponding decrease in the Colorado Equity Office.
Community First Choice: The bill includes a change in fund sources to reflect the higher match rate for long -
term services and supports under Community First Choice. The change saves $49.2 million General Fund. The
General Assembly approved Community First Choice to move selected long-term services and supports from
federal waivers that serve defined populations to the State Plan that serves all members. The Department will
still use assessments to determine service needs. States that implement Community First Choice receive an
additional federal match of six percentage points for the services.
ARPA HCBS adjustments: The bill includes the second -year impact of a supplemental that used unspent
money from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Home- and Community-Based Services (HCBS) grant for
provider rate bonuses so that the Department could spend the money by the federa l deadline of March 31,
2025. In addition, the supplemental made small true ups to appropriations to reflect actual expenditures by
project. In FY 2026-27, all of the one-time money comes out of the base.
Prepayment claims reviews: The bill includes additional resources for prepayment reviews and projected
savings from preventing improper billing and fraud.
