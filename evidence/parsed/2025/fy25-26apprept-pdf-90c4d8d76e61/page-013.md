TABOR Refund Obligation
Table 3D shows 2025 regular session bills that impact the TABOR refund obligation, which is paid out of the
General Fund. In Table 3D, positive numbers indicate an increase in the TABOR refund obligation while
negative numbers indicate a decrease. Holding revenue collections constant, decreasing the TABOR refund
obligation increases the amount of General Fund available for other uses.
