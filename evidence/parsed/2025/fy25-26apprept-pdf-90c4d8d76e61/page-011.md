Appropriations
Consistent with previous fiscal years, the General Assembly passed legislation to modify appropriations for the
current fiscal year (FY 2024-25) and make appropriations for the next fiscal year (FY 2025-26).
FY 2024-25 Appropriation Adjustment
Mid-year adjustments increased General Fund appropriations by a net $291.1 million (1.9 percent) relative to
the FY 2024- 25 appropriation from the 2024 legislative session.
FY 2025-26 Appropriation Adjustment
Total General Fund appropriations increased from $1 5.9 billion for FY 2024-25 (as adjusted in the 2025
session) to $16.9 billion for FY 2025-26. This $1.1 billion increase— 6.8 percent— is the result of bills that were
passed during the 202 4 regular session and the 2025 regular session.
Table 3A identifies bills that affected General Fund appropriations for FY 2024-25 and FY 2025-26, the total
General Fund appropriation (line 21), and the subset of General Fund appropriations that are subject to the
statutory 15.0 percent reserve requirement (line 23).
The table identifies individual bills with appropriation changes greater than $5.0 million and lumps bills with
changes below that amount into an “other bills” category. As shown in the table, the Long Bill makes up most
of the appropriations in both fiscal years.
