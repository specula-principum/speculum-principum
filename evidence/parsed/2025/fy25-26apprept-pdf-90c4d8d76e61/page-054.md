HAS Fee admin & refinance: The bill repurposes unused administrative appropriations from certain provider
fees on hospitals to replace General Fund for administration. This better aligns the use of the fee to workload
drivers. Additionally, the bill adds 2.7 FTE and contract funds to address increasing state and federal
requirements and help with hospital payment modeling, quality incentives, and discounted care programs.
The changes decrease appropriations by $5.1 million total funds, including $1.9 million General Fund, and
increase the FTE by 2.7. The provider fee is the Healthcare Affordability and Sustainability (HAS) Fee.
Accountable Care Collaborative: The bill includes a net reduction for phase III of the Accountable Care
Collaborative (ACC). The changes save $1.3 million total funds, including $0.7 million General Fund. The ACC
coordinates care for Medicaid members. Phase III includes increased funding for the Regional Accountable
Entities (RAEs) to support new contractual duties, especially when members transition out of inpatient and
residential settings. These increases are offset by projected savings from better healt h outcomes when people
receive increased supports when leaving hospital or residential settings.
Tobacco forecast: The bill includes a reduction of $1.3 million total funds to true up appropriations from
tobacco tax revenues to align with the most recent Office of State Planning and Budgeting revenue forecast.
Suicide crisis line unused funds: The bill includes a decrease of $1.2 million total funds, including $300,000
General Fund, related to the 988 suicide crisis hotline. The hotline is managed by the 988 Enterprise and is
funded by a surcharge on all phone lines. The Department included funding in contracts for the Regional
Accountable Entities, assuming the hotline would bill for Medicaid clients. This funding has been unutilized
because the hotline does not collect insurance information or bill for calls .
Personal services reduction: The bill includes a reduction to administration from vacant positions and
temporary employees related to authorized leave. The reduction saves $ 862,365 total funds, including
$373,843 General Fund, and 10.0 FTE.
Convert contracts to FTE: The bill reduces contract services and increases state FTE. The change saves
$509,065 total funds, including $66,999 General Fund, and adds 8.3 FTE. The specific contracts involve: 1)
county expenditure reviews to ensure only allowable costs are charged to Medicaid; and 2) user acceptance
testing and security analysis for eligibility systems.
Youth system of care: The bill includes a net decrease of $8,718 total funds for the implementation of a Youth
System of Care. The system of care is in response to a Settlement Agreement that alleged harm from a lack of
community and home-based services for Medicaid youth with intensive behavioral health needs. Amounts
reduce current funding for high fidelity wraparound services to align with population projections, and utilize
this funding to establish a Workforce Development Center for intensive services. Adjustments are provided in
the table below.
