Capitol Complex Leased Space
This line item provides funds to pay the Department of Personnel for property management of state-owned
facilities collectively referred to as the Capitol Complex. The Capitol Complex consists of buildings across the
state, including Denver (State Capitol and surrounding buildings), the Pierce Street facility, the North Campus,
the Grand Junction State Office Building, and Camp George West. The rental rate for each campus is calculated
as its proportional share, based on square footage, of total Capitol Complex property management costs. This
line item generally appears in each department's Executive Director's Office or its equivalent and provides
funding based on the department’s occupied square footage for each campus.
Community Provider Rates
A “community provider” is a non -state entity that provides services that might otherwise be provided by state
agencies. The “rate” is what state agencies pay community providers for those services. There was not a
common policy adjustment for FY 2025-26 for all providers. However, there was a 1.68 percent increase for
some medical providers through the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing. The total cost of that
adjustment was $148.7 million, including $52.6 million General Fund.
State Accounting System (CORE)
The Colorado Operations Resource Engine (CORE) is the state accounting and financial reporting system and is
managed by the Department of Personnel. The costs to operate CORE include employee salaries, operating
expenses, and technology costs. These costs are proportionally allocated to all departments based on their
actual system usage, as measured by the number of system reports created for each department. The CORE
Operations line item in each department’s Executive Director's Office, or its equivalent, provides funding for
the department’s share of operating and maintaining the state accounting system.
Digital Trunked Radios
The Digital Trunked Radios System (DTRS) common policy pays the operating costs of the Office of Public
Safety Communications in the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management in the Department
of Public Safety. The Department bills a flat rate per radio to cover those operating costs. For FY 2025-26, the
unit cost is $671.10 per radio, for the 15,736 radios operated by state agencies statewide, totaling
$10,560,452.
Legal Services
This line item provides funding to purchase necessary legal services from the Department of Law. The average
blended rate across agencies for FY 2025-26 is $146.06 per hour for legal services, which are provided by both
attorneys and legal assistants. This compares to a rate of $133.74 per hour for FY 2024 -25. The payments that
client agencies make to the Department of Law are sufficient to pay all the direct and indirect costs of
supplying the services. The Department of Law expects to provide 550,080 hour s of legal services to client
agencies in FY 2025-26, which compares to 575,280 hours in FY 2024 -25.
