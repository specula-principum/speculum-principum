Align facility payments with inflation : The bill includes an ongoing decrease of $442,860 to align the
community corrections facility payment with projected inflation through FY 2025 -26. The facility payment rose
faster than the Denver metro area consumer price index after FY 2017 -18 due to program closures. As
programs closed, the remaining providers received a higher payment. The reduced appropriation results in
approximately a $6,000 decrease in payments to individual facilities.
Reduce appropriation to PIVGP : The bill includes an ongoing decrease of $423,006 General Fund for the
Preventing Identity -based Violence Grant Program. This line item retains an appropriation of $500,000
General Fund after the reduction.
Reduce appropriation to PPE stockpile : The bill includes a decrease of $179 ,251 General Fund appropriated to
the continuously appropriated Emergency Stockpile Rotation Cash Fund for the State's personal protective
equipment (PPE) stockpile program. This includes the addition of a line item for an appropriation to the fund
rather than a direct appropriation to the program administration line item, to enable multi- year accounting for
assets and liabilities for the program.
Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ) 1% General Fund reduction: The bill includes a decrease of $110,000
General Fund to the DCJ Administrative Services line item for budget balancing purposes.
Remove unused methamphetamine abuse line item: The bill includes a decrease of $3,000 cash funds for the
Methamphetamine Abuse Task Force. The task force has been funded by gifts, grants, and donations.
However, the appropriation was not used in FY 2023-24 and almost all of it was unused from FY 2020- 21 to FY
2022-23. The reduction eliminates the line item.
Prior year actions: The bill includes a net decrease of $23.9 million for the FY 2025 -26 impact of prior year
budget decisions and legislation.
