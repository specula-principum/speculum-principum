General Fund Overview
This section summarizes the allocation of General Fund in FY 2024 -25 and FY 2025- 26. Section 1 summarizes
General Fund revenues, expenditures, and reserves for fiscal years 202 4-25 and 2025-26. Section 2
summarizes major legislative actions’ impact on the General Fund budget. Section 3 addresses constitutional
and statutory restrictions affecting General Fund revenues and appropriations. Details concerning the
allocation of cash and federal fund sources are included in the Summary Charts and Tables section of this Part
I, as well as in Part II for individual departments.
1. General Fund Budget Overview
This section provides an overview of the General Fund budget. Table 1 summarizes available General Fund
revenue, obligations, and year-end reserves for FY 2024-25 and 2025- 26.
The General Assembly used the March 2025 Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB) revenue forecast to
make final adjustments to the FY 2024-25 budget and prepare the FY 2025 -26 budget. This summary shows
the projected status of the General Fund as of the end of the 2025 Regular Session using that forecast. It does
not incorporate any subsequent forecast adjustments or revenue changes, such as the June 2025 revenue
forecasts or the impact of subsequent federal legislation. Consequently, s ome amounts will change in the
future.
As shown in Table 1, incorporating revenues anticipated to be available under the March 2025 OSPB revenue
forecast and the actions of the General Assembly during the 2025 legislative session, the General Fund was
projected to end FY 2024 -25 with a balance $20.1 million above the statutory reserve requirement and to end
FY 2025- 26 with a balance $9.6 million above the reserve requirement.

1 Senate Bill 25-310 (Proposition 130 Implementation) creates a General Fund warrant of $500.0 million to the Public Employees’ Retirement
Association (PERA) and specifies that the $500.0 million held by PERA remains part of the statutory General Fund reserve.
2 Current law requires a 15.0 percent reserve. However, H.B. 24-1231 (State Funding for Higher Education Projects) reduces the annual reserve
requirement by $41.3 million beginning in FY 2023-24 and H.B. 24- 1466 (Refinance Federal Coronavirus Recovery Funds) increases the reserve
requirement by $56.5 million for FY 2024-25 only.
