Appendix H: Severance Tax Operational Fund
This appendix describes the allocation of state severance tax revenues and anticipated expenditures from the
Severance Tax Operational Fund.
Severance Tax Revenue Allocation
Colorado collects taxes when people sever finite minerals or fuel from the land. Examples include oil and gas,
coal, metallic minerals, and molybdenum. Statutes allocate half the severance tax revenues to support local
governments. 22 The State splits the other half equally between water projects 23 and the Severance Tax
Operational Fund (Operational Fund) 24. In other words, the Operational Fund receives 25.0 percent of total
severance tax revenues. The Department of Natural Resources manages the Operational Fund.
Summary of 2025 legislative actions
Appropriations from the Operational Fund fall into two main categories – core programs and discretionary
programs. The funding for discretionary programs depends on enough severance tax revenues. The following
table outlines appropriations in the current fiscal year and expected appropriations in FY 2025 -26.
