Tobacco Taxes: Amendment 35, approved by the voters in November 2004, imposed new cigarette and
tobacco taxes through the addition of Section 21 of Article X of the State Constitution. The additional tobacco
tax revenues approved in the amendment are also exempt from the TABOR revenue limit, and appropriations
from these revenues are also exempt from the statutory restriction on General Fund appropriations (discussed
below). Amendment 35 requires that a portion of the additional tobacco tax revenues be credited to the
General Fund and made available to the Department of Public Health and Environment for immunization
services and to the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing for the Children’s Basic Health Plan.
Table 5 shows appropriations of Amendment 35 revenues to those two Departments for FY 2024 -25 and FY
2025-26. For more information about Amendment 35 appropriations, see Appendix J.

Statutory Restriction on Appropriations
Current statute restricts General Fund appropriations to 5.0 percent of Colorado personal income. 5 It also
exempts certain appropriations from this restriction, including those related to new federal mandates,
requirements of final court orders, and voter -approved revenue increases. 6
The General Assembly has also exempted certain other transfers and appropriations from the restriction for
other reasons. For example, statute exempts transfers to the Capital Construction Fund. 7 Appropriations
associated with the senior citizen and disabled veteran property tax exemption are also exempt based on
voter approval of Section 3.5 (3) of Article X of the State Constitution.
Table 6 shows the calculation of the statutory restriction on General Fund appropriations for FY 2025 -26. As
shown in the table, the FY 2025 -26 General Fund appropriation is approximately $7.0 billion below the
statutory limit, after accounting for $403.7 million in appropriations that are exempt from the restriction. For
additional information on the specific amounts that are exempt from the restriction, see Appendix D.
