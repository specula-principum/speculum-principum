FY 2024-25 Mid-year Adjustments
Senate Bill 25- 095 (Supplemental Bill) increases appropriations by $1.0 million total funds. The most significant
change is an increase of $5.1 million General Fund for Adoption and Relative Guardianship caseload. The
increase is partially offset by decreases driven by caseload changes, implementation delays, and technical
adjustments to several programs. Additional details can be found in the FY 2024 -25 Supplemental Narrative.
