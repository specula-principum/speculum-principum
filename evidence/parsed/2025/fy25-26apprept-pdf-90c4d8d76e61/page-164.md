and Medical Insurance program. The previous rate was 0.15 percent. The appropriation for FY 2025-26 is
$2,014,948 total funds, including $1,103,847 General Fund.
Step Plan
The step plan is a tenure -based compensation system implemented in FY 2024 -25 through the collective
bargaining process with the Colorado WINS union. Employees included in the step system are expected to
receive regular salary increases based on how long t hey have been employed by the State. The appropriation
for FY 2025-26 is $16,450,808 total funds, including $9,852,469 General Fund.
Temporary Employees Related to Authorized Leave
The Temporary Employees Related to Authorized Leave line item was funded beginning in FY 2022 -23 to
provide departments the ability to offer employees paid family and medical leave. The paid family and medical
leave program had not been implemented yet, and had no funding, so this line item was added to
departments’ budgets so that employees could take paid family or medical leave prior to the program being
funded. Because the paid family and medical leave program is now funded, this line item has no purpose. For
FY 2025- 26, the appropriation for this line item is reduced by $4,518,781 total funds, including a reduction of
$3,176,233 General Fund.
Unfunded Liability Amortization Equalization Disbursement
Payments
The State contributes additional funds to assist in the amortization of PERA’s unfunded liability. The
contributions are a statutory percentage of state employee base salaries plus salary increases and shift
differential pay. Contributions are 10.0 percent of salaries for all state employees. The intended fund source
for contributions pursuant to S.B. 06 -235 (called the Supplemental Amortization Equalization Disbursement) is
money that would otherwise be available for, but has not been awarded as, employee salary increases. While
this payment is effectively made by the State, these funds represent foregone employee salary increases that
would otherwise appear in the salary base as employee compensation. The appropriation for FY 2025 -26 is
$287,541,831 total funds, including $157,402,685 General Fund.
Operating Common Policies
Administrative Law Judge Services
Funds for Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) services, provided by the Office of Administrative Courts in the
Department of Personnel, are included for the 13 departments that use these services. Billing is calculated by
identifying the budget year's base costs (employee salaries, operating expenses, and indirect costs) plus the
program's share of the Department of Personnel's prior fiscal year benefits and common policy costs. These
costs are then allocated to departments for the upcoming fiscal year (FY 2025 -26) according to the actual
percentage of service hours each agency utilized in the last fiscal year for which complete data is available (FY
2023-24).
