Courts and Probation. Additional details can be found in the FY 2024 -25 Supplemental Narrative.
Senate Bill 25-206 (Long Bill Supplemental) increased appropriations by a net of $1.1 million General Fund.

increased costs of representation. This increase was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease for the Judicial
Ombudsman Office and the Office of the Child’s Representativ e for expected under-expenditures.
