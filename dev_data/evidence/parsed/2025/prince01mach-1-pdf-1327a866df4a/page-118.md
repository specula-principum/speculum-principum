THE PRINCE 107
I will give a modern instance of this. Pre’
Luca, a follower of Maximilian, the present em-
peror, speaking of his majesty said that he never
took counsel with anybody, and yet that he never
did anything as he wished; this arose from his
following the contrary method to the aforesaid.
As the emperor isa secret man he does not com-
municate his designs to any one or take any ad-
vice, but as on putting them into effect they
begin to be known and discovered, they begin
to be opposed by those he has about him, and
he is easily diverted from his purpose. Hence it
comes to pass that what he does one day he un-
does the next, no one ever understands what he
wishes or intends to do, and no reliance is to be
placed on his deliberations.
A prince, therefore, ought always to take
counsel, but only when he wishes, not when
others wish; on the contrary he ought to dis-
courage absolutely attempts to advise him un-
less he asks it,but he ought to be a great asker,
and a patient hearer of the truth about those
things of which he has inquired; indeed, if he
finds that any one has scruples in telling him
the truth he should be angry. And since some
think that a prince who gains the reputation of
being prudent is so considered, not by his nature
but by the good counsellors he has about him,
they are undoubtedly deceived. It isan infallible
rule that a prince who is not wise himselfcannot
be well advised, unless by chance he leaves him-
self entirely in the hands of one man who rules
him in everything, and happens to be a very
prudent man. In this case he may doubtless be
well governed, but itwould not last long, for that
