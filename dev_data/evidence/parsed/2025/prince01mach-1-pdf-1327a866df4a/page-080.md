THE PRINCE 69
considered liberal, another misero ormiserly (using
a Tuscan term, seeing that avaro with us still
means one who is rapaciously acquisitive and
misero one who makes grudging use of his own)
one a free giver, another rapacious; one cruel,
another merciful; one a breaker of his word,
another trustworthy; one effeminate and pusil-
lanimous, another fierce and high-spirited; one
humane, another haughty; one lascivious, an-
other chaste; one frank, another astute; one hard,
another easy; one serious, another frivolous; one
religious, another an unbeliever, and so on. [JL
know that every one will admit that itjwould be
highly praiseworthy in a prince to possess all.the
above-named qualities that are reputed good,
but as they cannot all be possessed or observed,
human conditions not permitting ofit, itis neces-
sary that he should be prudent enough to avoid ^
theTscandal of those vices which would lose him
the_state, and guard himself if possible against
those which will not lose it him,, but if not able
to, he can indulge them with less scruple. And
yet he must not mind incurring the scandal of
those vices, without wdiich it would be difficult
to save the state, for ifone considers well, it will
be found that some things which seem virtues
would, iffollowed) lead to one’s ruin, and some
otherFwhich appear vices result in one’s greater
security"and wellbeing.
