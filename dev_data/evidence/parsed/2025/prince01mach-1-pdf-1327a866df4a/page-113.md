102 NICCOL0 machiavelli
the companion of a fortune which may rise
again. In the second case, when those who
fight are such that you have nothing to fear
from the victor, itis stillmore prudent on your
part to adhere to one; for you go to the ruin of
one with the help of him who ought to save him
ifhe were wise, and if he conquers he rests at
your discretion, and it is impossible that he
should not conquer with your help.
And here it should be noted that a prince
oughlfnever to make common cause with one
more powerful than himself to injure another,
unlessTIecessity" forces him to it, as before said;
for ifhe wins you rest in his power, and princes
must avoid as much as possible being under the
will and pleasure of others. The Venetians
united with France against the Duke of Milan,
although they could have avoided that alliance,
and from it resulted their own ruin. But when
one cannot avoid it,as happened in the case of
the Florentines when the Pope and Spain went
with their armies to attack Lombardy, then the
prince ought to join for the above reasons. Let
no state believe that itcan always follow a safe
policy, rather let it think that all are doubtful.
This is found in the nature of things, that one
never tries to avoid one difficulty without run-
ning into another, but prudence consists in be-
ing able to know the nature of the difficulties,
and taking the least harmful as good.
A prince must also show himself a lover of
merit, give preferment to the able, and honour
those who excel in every art. Moreover he must
encourage his citizens to follow their callings
quietly, whether in commerce, or agriculture,
