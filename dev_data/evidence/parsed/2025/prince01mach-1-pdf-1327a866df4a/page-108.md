THE PRINCE 97
secure refuge against a sudden assault. I ap-
prove this method, because it was anciently
used. Nevertheless, Messer Niccolo Vitelli has
been seen in our own time to destroy two fortresses
in Citta di Castello in order to keep that state.
Guid’Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to
his dominions from which he had been driven
by Cesare Borgia, razed to their foundations all
the fortresses of that province, and considered
that without them itwould be more difficult for
him to lose the state again. The Bentivogli, in
returning to Bologna, took similar measures.
Therefore fortresses may or may not be useful
according 'to the times; if they do good in one
way, they do harm in another. The question
may be discussed thus: a prince who fears his
own people more than foreigners ought to build
fortresses, but he who has greater fear of for-
eigners than of his own people ought to do
without them. The castle of Milan built by
Francesco Sforza has given and will give more
trouble to the house of Sforza than any other
disorder in that state. Therefore the best for-
tressis to be found in the love of the people, for
although you may have fortresses they will not
save you ifyou are hated by the people. When
once the people have taken arms against you,
there will never be lacking foreigners to assist
them. In our times we do not see that they have
profited any ruler, except the Countess of Forli
on the death of her consort Count Girolamo, for
she was thus enabled to escape the popular
rising and await help from Milan and recover the
state; the circumstances being then such that no
foreigner could assist the people. But afterwards
