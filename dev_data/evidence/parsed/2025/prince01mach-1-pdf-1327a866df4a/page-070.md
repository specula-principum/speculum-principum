THE PRINCE 59
began to hire foreigners as soldiers. The firstto
bring into reputation this kind of militia was
Alberigo da Como, a native ofRomagna. Braccio
and Sforza, who were in their day the arbiters of
Italy were, amongst others, trained by him.
After these came all those others who up to the
present day have commanded the armies of Italy,
and the result of their prowess has been that
Italy has been overrun by Charles, preyed on by
Louis, tyrannised over by Ferrando, and insulted
by the Swiss. The system adopted by them was,
in the firstplace, to increase their own reputa-
tion by discrediting the infantry. They did- this
because, as they had no country and lived on
their earnings, a few foot soldiers did not aug-
ment their reputation, and they could not main-
tain a large number and therefore they restricted
themselves almost entirely to cavalry, by which
with a smaller number they were well paid and
honoured. They reduced things to such a state
that in an army of 20,000 soldiers there were not
2,000 foot. They had also used eveiy means to
spare themselves and the soldiers any hardship
or fear by not killing each other in their en-
counters, but taking prisoners without expecta-
tion of ransom. They made no attacks on forti-
fications by night; and those in the fortifications
did not attack the tents at night, they made no
stockades or ditches round their camps, and did
not take the field in winter. All these things were
permitted by their military code, and adopted,
as we have said, to avoid trouble and danger, so
that they have reduced Italy to slavery and de-
gradation.
