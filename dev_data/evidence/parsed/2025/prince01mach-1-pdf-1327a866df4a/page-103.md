92 NICCOL0 machiavelli
hands of the soldiers, he isbound to keep their
friendship regardless of the people. And it isto
be noted that this state of the Sultan is different
from that of all other princes, being similar to
the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called
either a hereditary kingdom or a new one, for the
sons of the dead prince are not his heirs, but
he who is elected to that position by those who
have authority. And as this order is ancient it
cannot be called a new kingdom, there being
none ofthese difficulties which exist in new ones;
as although the prince is new, the rules of that
state are old and arranged to receive him as ifhe
were their hereditary lord.
But returning to our matter, I say that who-
ever studies the preceding argument will see that
either hatred or contempt were the causes ofthe
ruin ofthe emperors named, and will also observe
how itcame about that, some of them acting in
one way and some in another, in both ways there
were some who had a fortunate and others an
unfortunate ending. As Pertinax and Alexander
were both new rulers, itwas useless and injurious
for them to try and imitate Marcus, who was a
hereditary prince; and similarly with Caracalla,
Commodus, and Maximinus it was pernicious
for them to imitate Severus, as they had not
sufficient ability to follow in his footsteps. Thus
a new prince cannot imitate the actions ofMar-
cus, in his dominions, nor is it necessary for him
to imitate those of Severus; but he must take
from Severus those things that are necessary to
found his state, and from Marcus those that are
useful and glorious for conserving a state that is
already established and secure.
