108 NICCOL0 machiavelli
governor would in a short time deprive him of
the state; but by taking counsel with many, a
prince who is not wise will never have united
councils and will not be able to bring them to
unanimity for himself. The counsellors will all
think of their own interests, and he will be un-
able either to correct or to understand them.
And itcannot be otherwise, for men will always
be false to you unless they are compelled by
necessity to be true. Therefore it must be con-
cluded that wise counsels, from whoever they
come, must necessarily be due to the prudence
ofthe prince, and not the prudence ofthe prince
to the good counsels received.
