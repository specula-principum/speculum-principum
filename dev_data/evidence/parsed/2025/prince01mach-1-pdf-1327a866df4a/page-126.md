EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE
BARBARIANS
aving now considered all the things we have
Hspoken of,and thought within myselfwhether
atpresent the time was not propitious inItaly for a
new prince, and if there was not a state of things
which offered an opportunity to a prudent and
capable man to introduce a new system that
would do honour to himselfand good to the mass
of the people, it seems to me that so many things
concur to favour a new ruler that I do not know
of any time more fitting for such an enterprise.
And if,as I said, it was necessary in order that
the power of Moses should be displayed that the
people of Israel should be slaves in Egypt, and
to give scope for the greatness and courage of
Cyrus that the Persians should be oppressed by
the Medes, and to illustrate the pre-eminence of
Theseus that the Athenians should be dispersed,
so at the present time, in order that the might of
an Italian genius might be recognised, it was
necessary that Italy should be reduced to her
present condition, and that she should be more
enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than
the Persians, and more scattered than the Athe-
nians; without a head, without order, beaten, de-
spoiled, lacerated, and overrun, and that she
should have suffered ruin of every kind.
And although before now a gleam of hope has
appeared which gave hope that some individual
might be appointed by God for her redemption.
