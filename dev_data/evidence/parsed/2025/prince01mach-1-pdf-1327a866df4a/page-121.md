IIO niccolO machiavelli
are not lostthat have enough strength to be able
to keep an army in the field. Philip ofMacedon,
not the father of Alexander the Great, but the
one who was conquered by Titus Quintius, did
not possess a great state compared to the great-
ness of Rome and Greece which assailed him,
but being a military man and one who knew how
to ingratiate himself with the people and make
sure of the great, he was able to sustain the war
against them for many years; and if at length he
lost his power over some cities, he was stillable
to keep his kingdom.
Therefore, those of our princes who had held
their possessions for many years must not accuse
fortune for having lost them, but rather their
own remissness; for having never in quiet times
considered that things might change (as it is
a common fault of men not to reckon on storms
in fair weather) when adverse times came,
they only thought of fleeing, instead of defend-
ing themselves; and hoped that the people, en-
raged by the insolence of the conquerors, would
recall them. This measure, when others are
wanting, is good; but it is very bad to have
neglected the other remedies for that one, for
nobody would desire to fall because he believed
that he would then find some one to pick him
up. This may or may not take place, and if it
does, it does not afford you security, as you have
not helped yourself but been helped like a cow-
ard. Only those defences are good, certain and
durable, which depend on yourself alone and
your own ability.
