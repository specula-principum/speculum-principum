THE PRINCE
others is,as may now be seen, a cause of danger
to that kingdom. For by giving such reputation
to the Swiss, France has disheartened all her own
troops, the infantry having been abolished and
the men-at-arms being obliged to foreigners for
assistance; for being accustomed to fight with
Swiss troops, they think they cannot conquer
without them. Whence itcomes that the French
are insufficiently strong to oppose the Swiss, and
without the aid ofthe Swiss they will not venture
against others. The armies of the French are »
thus of a mixed kind, partly mercenary and
partly her own; taken together they are much
better than troops entirely composed of mercen-
aries or auxiliaries, but much inferior to national
forces.
And let this example be sufficient, for the king-
dom of France would be invincible if Charles’s
military organization had been developed or
maintained. But men with their lack of pru-
dence initiate novelties and, finding the first
taste good, do not notice the poison within, as
I pointed out previously in regard to wasting
fevers.
The prince, therefore, who fails to recognis^
troubles in his state as they arise, is not truly
wise, and it is given to few to be thus. If we
consider the first cause of the collapse of the
Roman Empire we shall find it merely due to
the hiring of Goth mercenaries, for from that
time we find the Roman strength begin to
weaken. All the advantages derived from the
Empire fellto the Goths.
I conclude then by saying that no prince is
secure without his own troops, on the contrary
