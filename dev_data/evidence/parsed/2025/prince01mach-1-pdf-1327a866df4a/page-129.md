countries, itis before all things necessary, as the
true foundation of every undertaking, to provide
yourself with your own forces, for you cannot
have more faithful, or truer and better soldiers.
And although each one of them may be good,
they will united become even better when they
see themselves commanded by their prince, and
honoured and favoured by him. It is therefore
necessary to prepare such forces in order to be
able with Italian prowess to defend the country
from foreigners. And although both the Swiss
and Spanish infantry are deemed terrible, none
the less they each have their defects, so that a
third method of array might not only oppose
them, but be confident of overcoming them.
For the Spaniards cannot sustain the attack of
cavalry, and the Swiss have to fear infantry
which meets them with resolution equal to their
own. From which it has resulted, as will be seen
by experience, that the Spaniards cannot sus-
tain the attack of French cavalry, and the Swiss
are overthrown by Spanish infantry. And al-
though a complete example of the latter has not
been seen, yet an instance was furnished in the
battle of Ravenna, where the Spanish infantry
attacked the German battalions, which are or-
ganised in the same way as the Swiss. The
Spaniards, through their bodily agility and aid-
ed by their bucklers, had entered between and
under their pikes and were in a position toattack
them safely without the Germans being able to
defend themselves; and if the cavalry had not
charged them they would have utterly destroyed
them. Knowing therefore the defects of both
these kinds ofinfantry, a third kind can be created
