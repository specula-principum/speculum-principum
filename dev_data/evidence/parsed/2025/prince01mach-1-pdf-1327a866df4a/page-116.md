THE PRINCE 105
cannot hope to deceive him and therefore re-
mains good.
For a prince to be able to know a minister
there is this method which never fails. When
you see the minister think more of himself than
of you, and in all his actions seek his own profit,
such a man will never be a good minister, and
you can never rely on him; for whoever has in
hand the state of another must never think of
himself but of the prince, and not mind any-
thing but what relates to him. And, on the
other hand, the prince, in order to retain his
fidelity ought to think of his minister, honouring
and enriching him, doing him kindnesses, and
conferring on him honours and giving him re-
sponsible tasks, so that the great honours and
riches bestowed on him cause him not to desire
other honours and riches, and the offices he
holds make him fearful of changes. When
princes and their ministers stand in this rela-
tion to each other, they can rely the one upon
the other; when it is otherwise, the result is
always injurious either for one or the other of
them.
