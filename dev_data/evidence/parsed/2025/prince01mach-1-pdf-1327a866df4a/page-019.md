8 NICCOLd MACHIAVELLI
otherwise inclined they will have greater cause
to fear him. Any external Power who wishes
to assail that state will be less disposed to do so;
so that as long as he resides there he will be very
hard to dispossess.
The other and better remedy is to plant
colonies in one or two ofthose places which form
as itwere the keys of the land, for itis necessary
either to do this or to maintain a large force of
armed men. The colonies will cost the prince
little;with little or no expense on his part, he
can send and maintain them; he only injures
those whose lands and houses are taken to give
to the new inhabitants, and these form but a
small proportion of the state, and those who are
injured, remaining poor and scattered, can never
do any harm to him, and all the others are, on
the one hand, not injured and therefore easily
pacified; and, on the other, are fearful of offend-
ing lest they should be treated like those who
have been dispossessed. To conclude, these
colonies cost nothing, are more faithful, and
give less offence; and the injured parties being
poor and scattered are unable to do mischief,
as I have shown. For it must be noted, that

men must either be caressed or else annihilated;
they will revenge themselves for small injuries,
but cannot do so for great ones; the injury there-
fore that we do to a man must be such that we
need not fear his vengeance. But by maintain-
ing a garrison instead of colonists, one will spend
much more, and consume all the revenues of
that state in guarding it,so that the acquisition
will result in a loss,besides giving much greater
offence, since it injures every one in that state
