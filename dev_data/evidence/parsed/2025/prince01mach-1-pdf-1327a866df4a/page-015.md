, CHAPTER II
OF HEREDITARY MONARCHIES
will not here speak of republics, having
I already treated ofthem fully in another place.
Rwill deal only with monarchies, and will^dis-
cuss how the various kinds described above cap
be governed and maintained. IntKeffirst place,
the 'difficulty of maintaining hereditary states
accustomed to a reigning family is far less than
in new monarchies; for it is sufficient not to
transgress ancestral usages, and to adapt one’s
selfto unforeseen circumstances; in this way such
a prince, if of ordinary assiduity, will always
be able to maintain his position, unless some
very exceptional and excessive force deprives him
of it; and even if he be thus deprived, on the
slightest mischance happening to the new occu-
pier, he will be able to regain it.
We have in Italy the example of the Duke of
Ferrara, who was able to withstand the assaults
of the Venetians in 1484 and of Pope Julius in
1510, for no other reason than because of the
antiquity of his iamily in that dominion. In as
much as the legitimate prince has less cause and
less necessity to give offence, it is only natural
that he should be more loved; and, if no extra-
ordinary vices make him hated, it isonly reason-
able for his subjects to be naturally attached to
him, the memories and causes ofinnovationsbeing
forgotten in the long period over which his rule
has extended; whereas one change always leaves
the way prepared for the introduction of another.
