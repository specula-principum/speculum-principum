116 NICCOL0 machiavelli
yet at the highest summit of his career he was
thrown aside by fortune, so that now, almost
lifeless,she awaits one who may heal her wounds
and put a stop to the pillaging of Lombardy, to
the rapacity and extortion in the Kingdom of
Naples and in Tuscany, and cure her of those
sores which have long been festering. Behold
how she prays God to send some one to redeem
her from this barbarous cruelty and insolence.
Behold her ready and willing to follow any
standard if only there be some one to raise it.
There isnothing now she can hope for but that
your illustrious house may place itself at the
head of this redemption, being by itspower and
fortune so exalted, and being favoured by God
and the Church, of which it is now the ruler.
Nor will this be very difficult,ifyou call to mind
the actions and lives of the men I have named.
And although those men were rare and mar-
vellous, they were none the less men, and each
of them had less opportunity than the present,
for their enterprise was not juster than this, nor
easier, nor was God more their friend than He
is yours. Here is a just cause; ‘iustum enim est
bellum quibus necessarium, etpia arma ubi nulla nisi
in armis spes est.' Here isthe greatest willingness,
nor can there be great difficulty where there is
great willingness, provided that the measures
are adopted ofthose whom I have set before you
as examples. Besides this, unexampled wonders
have been seen here performed by God, the sea
has been opened, a cloud has shown you the
road, the rock has given forth water, manna has
rained, and everything has contributed to your
greatness, the remainder must be done by you.
