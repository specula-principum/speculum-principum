76 NICCOL0 machiavelli
Spain, which arose from nothing but his exces-
sive kindness, which allowed more licence to the
soldiers than was consonant with military dis-
cipline. He was reproached with this in the
senate by Fabius Maximus, who called him a cor-
rupter of the Roman militia. Locri having been
destroyed by one of Scipio’s officers was not
revenged by him, nor was the insolence of that
officer punished, simply by reason of his easy
nature; so much so, that some one wishing to
excuse him in the senate, said that there were
many men who knew rather how not to err, than
how to correct the errors of others. This disposi-
tion would in time have tarnished the fame and
glory of Scipio had he persevered in it under
the empire, but living under the rule of the
senate this harmful quality was not only con-
cealed but became a glory to him.
I conclude, therefore, with regard to being
feared and loved, that men love at their own free
will, but fear at the will of the prince, and that
a wise prince must rely on what is in his power
and not on what is in the power of others, and
he must only contrive to avoid incurring hatred,
as has been explained.
