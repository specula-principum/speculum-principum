THE PRINCE
CHAPTER I
THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE
WAYS BY WHICH THEY ARE ESTABLISHED
,L states and dominions which hold or have
held sway over mankind are either republics
or monarchies. Monarchies are either hereditary
in which the rulers have been for many years
of the same family, or else they are of recent
foundation. The newly founded ones are either
entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza,
or else they are, as itwere, new members grafted
on to the hereditary possessions of the prince that
annexes them, as isthe kingdom of Naples to the
King of Spain. The dominions thus acquired
have either been previously accustomed to the
rule of another prince, or else have been free
states, and they are annexed either by force of
arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else
fallto him by good fortune or special ability.
