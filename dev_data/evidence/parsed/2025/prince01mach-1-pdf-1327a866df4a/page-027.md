CHAPTER IV
WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, OCCUPIED BY ALEX-
ANDER, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCES-
SORS OF THE LATTER AFTER HIS DEATH
onsidering the difficulties there are in hold-
C ing anewly acquired state,some may wonder
how it came to pass that Alexander the Great
became master of Asia in a few years, and had
hardly occupied itwhen he died, from which
itmight be supposed that the whole state would
have rebelled. However, his successors main-
tained themselves in possession, and had no
further difficulties in doing so than those which
arose among themselves from their own ambi-
tions.
I reply that the kingdoms known to history
have been governed in two ways: either by a
prince and his servants, who, as ministers by his
grace and permission, assist in governing the
realm; or by a prince and by barons, who hold
their positions not by favour of the ruler but by
antiquity of blood. Such barons have states and
subjects of their own, who recognise them as
their lords, and are naturally attached to them.
In those states which are governed by a prince
and his servants, the prince possesses more
authority, because there is no one in the state
regarded as a superior other than himself, and
ifothers are obeyed itis merely as ministers and
officials of the prince, and no one regards them
with any special affection.
Examples of these two kinds of government in
