66 NICCOLd MACHIAVELLI
cjjfmilitary matters, besides the other misfortunes
already mentioned, cannot be esteemed by his
soldiers, nor have confidence in them.
He ought, therefore, never to let his thoughts
stray from the exercise of war; and in peace he
ought to practise it more than in war, which he
can do in two ways: by action and by study. As
to action, he must, besides keeping his men well
disciplined and exercised, engage continually in
hunting, and thus accustom his body to hard-

be necessary to observe; for the hillsand valleys,
plains and rivers of Tuscany, for instance, have

a certain resemblance to those of other provinces,
so that from a knowledge of the country in one
province one can easily arrive at a knowledge of
others. And that prince who is lacking in this
skillis wanting in the first essentials of a leader;

take up quarters, lead armies, plan battles and
lay siege to towns with advantage.
