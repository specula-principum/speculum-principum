THE PRINCE 39
houses. After waiting some days to arrange all
that was necessary to his villainous projects,
Oliverotto invited Giovanni Fogliani and all the
principal men of Fermo to a grand banquet.
After the dinner and the entertainments usual
at such feasts, Oliverotto artfully introduced cer-
tain important matters of discussion, speaking of
the greatness of Pope Alexander, and of his son
Cesare, and of their enterprises. To which dis-
courses Giovanni and others having replied, he
all at once rose, saying that these matters should
be spoken of in a more private place, and with-
drew into a room where Giovanni and the other
citizens followed him. They were no sooner
seated than soldiers rushed out of hiding-places
and killed Giovanni and all the others. After
which massacre Oliverotto mounted his horse,
rode through the town and besieged the chief
magistrate in his palace, so that through fear
they were obliged to obey him and form a govern-
ment, ofwhich he made himselfprince. And all
those being dead who, ifdiscontented, could in-
jure him, he fortified himself with new orders,
civil and military, in such a way that within the
year that he held the principality he was not only
safe himself in the city ofFermo, but had become
formidable to all his neighbours. And his over-
throw would have been difficult, like that of
Agathocles, ifhe had not allowed himself to be
deceived by Cesare Borgia, when he captured
the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigaglia, as already
related, where he also was taken, one year after
the parricide he had committed, and strangled,
together with Vitellozzo, who had been his
teacher in ability and atrocity.
