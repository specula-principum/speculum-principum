THE PRINCE 71
ing his people, so that he is really liberal to all
those from whom he does not take, who are in-
finite in number, and niggardly to all to whom
he does not give, who are few. In our times we
have seen nothing great done except by those
who have been esteemed niggardly; the others
have all been ruined. Pope Julius II, although
he had made use of a reputation for liberality in
order to attain the papacy, did not seek to retain
it afterwards, so that he might be able to wage
war. The present King ofFrance has carried on
so many wars without imposing an extraordinary
tax, because his extra expenses were covered by
the parsimony he had so long practised. The
present King of Spain, if he had been thought
liberal, would not have engaged in and been
successful in so many enterprises.
For these reasons a prince must care littlefor
the reputation of being a miser, if he wishes to
avoid robbing his subjects, ifhe wishes to be able
to defend himself, to avoid becoming poor and
contemptible, and not to be forced to become
rapacious; this niggardliness is one of those vices
which enable him to reign. If it is said that
Caesar attained the empire through liberality,
and that many others have reached the highest
positions through being liberal or being thought
so, I would reply that you are either a prince
already or else on the way to become one. In
the firstcase, this liberality is harmful; in the
second, it is certainly necessary to be considered
liberal. Caesar was one of those who wished to
attain the mastery over Rome, but ifafter attain-
ing it he had lived and had not moderated his
expenses, he would have destroyed that empire.
