PREFACE vii
conditions of to-day. Those elements of human
nature and ofpolitics which remain the same now
as then are immediately apparent in Machia-
velli’spages, but they were not invented by him,
and where they are evil he is not to be blamed.
The reader who may wish tostudy Machiavelli
more closely in the English language is recom-
mended to consult the following works, bearing
in mind, however, that criticism on the subject
has advanced in Italy since the appearance ofthe
firsttwo mentioned:
pasquale viLLARi, The Life and Times ofJViccold
Machiavelli. London, Fisher Unwin. 1892.
l. a. burd, IIPrincipe. Oxford, 1891 (text and
commentary)
MARIO PRAZ, op. cit.
The best text of II Principe isthat of Mazzoni
and Casella already mentioned; an excellent
Italian commentary is that by Giuseppe Lisio,
Firenze, Sansoni, 1915.
