NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI
TO
LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT
SON OF PIERO DI MEDICI
t iscustomary for those who wish to gain the
I favour of a prince to endeavour to do so by
offering him giftsof those things which they hold
most precious, or in which they know him to
take especial delight. In this way princes are
often presented with horses, arms, cloth of gold,
gems, and such-like ornaments worthy of their
grandeur. In my desire, however, tooffer to Your
Highness some humble testimony of my devo-
tion, I have been unable to find among my pos-
sessions anything which I hold so dear or esteem
so highly as that knowledge of the deeds of great
men which I have acquired through a long ex-
perience of modern events and a constant study
of the past.
With the utmost diligence I have long
pondered and scrutinised the actions of the
great, and now I offer the results toYour High-
ness within the compass of a small volume: and
although I deem this work unworthy of Your
Highness’s acceptance, yet my confidence in
your humanity assures me that you will receive
it with favour, knowing that it is not in my
power to offer you a greater gift than that of
enabling you to understand in a very short time
all those things which I have learnt at the cost
of privation and danger in the course of many
