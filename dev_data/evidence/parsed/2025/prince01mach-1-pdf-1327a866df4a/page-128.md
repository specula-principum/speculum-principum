THE PRINCE 117
God will not do everything, in order not to de-
prive us of freewill and the portion of the glory
that falls to our lot.
It is no marvel that none of the before-men-
tioned Italians have done that which itis to be
hoped your illustrious house may do; and if in
so many revolutions in Italy and so many war-
like operations, it always seems as if military
capacity were extinct, this is because the ancient
methods were not good, and no one has arisen
whoknew how to discover new ones. Nothing does
so much honour to a newly-risen man than the
new laws and measures which he introduces.
These things, when they are well based and have
greatness in them, render him revered and ad-
mired, and there isnot lacking scope in Italy for
the introduction of every kind of new organisa-
tion. Here there isgreat virtue in the members,
ifitwere not wanting in the heads. Look how in
duels and in contests of a few the Italians are
superior in strength, dexterity, and intelligence.
But when it comes to armies they make a poor
show; which proceeds entirely from the weak-
ness of the leaders, for those that know are not
obeyed, and every one thinks that he knows,
there being hitherto nobody who has raised him-
self so high both by valour and fortune as to
make the others yield. Hence it comes about
that for so long a time, in all the wars waged
during the last twenty years, whenever there has
been an entirely Italian army ithas always been
a failure, as witness firstTaro, then Alexandria,
Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, and Mestri.
If your illustrious house, therefore, wishes to
follow those great men who redeemed their
