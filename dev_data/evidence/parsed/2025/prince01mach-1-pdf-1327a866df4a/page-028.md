THE PRINCE 1
our own time are those of the Turk and the
King of France. All the Turkish monarchy is
governed by one ruler, the others are his ser-
vants, and dividing his kingdom into “sangia-

and changes or recalls them at his pleasure. But
the King of France is surrounded by a large

their prerogatives, of which the king cannot de-

The causes of the difficulty of occupying the
Turkish kingdom are, that the invader could not
be invited by princes of that kingdom, nor hope
to facilitate his enterprise by the rebellion of
those near the ruler’s person, as will be evident
from reasons given above. Because, being all
slaves, and dependent, itwill be more difficult
to corrupt them, and even ifthey were corrupted,
littleeffect could be hoped for, as they would
not be able to carry the people with them for the
reasons mentioned. Therefore, whoever assaults
the Turk must be prepared to meet his united
forces, and must rely more on his own strength
than on the disorders of others; but having once

he can no longer raise armies, nothing else isto
be feared except the family of the prince, and if
