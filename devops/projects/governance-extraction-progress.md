# Governance Extraction Progress Log

## 2025-11-15T03:45:00Z – Workstream A: Corpus Intake & Parsing (Colorado Legislative Docs)
- tasks: Registered new Colorado governance PDFs (`CCIOA` law summary, FY25-26 Joint Budget Committee Appropriations Report) and ran baseline parsing through main CLI with outputs under `evidence/parsed/2025/`.
- commands: `/home/ubuntu/speculum-principum/.venv/bin/python -m main parse --output-root evidence/parsed pdf evidence/application_of_the_colorado_common_interest_ownership_act_ccioa_in_hoa_communities_-_colorado_law_summary.pdf`; `/home/ubuntu/speculum-principum/.venv/bin/python -m main parse --output-root evidence/parsed pdf evidence/fy25-26apprept.pdf`.
- verification: Both commands exited 0; new directories `application-of-the-colorado-common-interest-owne-1fd3070980ab/` (4 pages) and `fy25-26apprept-pdf-90c4d8d76e61/` (184 pages) created with `index.md` listings and per-page Markdown; `evidence/parsed/README.md` updated with checksums and review notes.
- quality_review: Spot-checked HOA summary page 1 (statutory references intact, minor OCR spacing) and budget report pages 1 & 10 (tables flattened but numeric values preserved). No blank pages or catastrophic OCR failures observed; large budget document will need segmentation tuning for tables and section numbering in later workstreams.
- fixes_applied: Added README entries describing review outcomes; no parser configuration changes required yet.
- remaining_issues: Hyphenation artifacts persist (`summar y`, `fore cast`); table structure collapsed to paragraphs—flag for Workstream B/C improvements. Need to capture HTML sources to diversify corpus beyond PDFs.
- next_steps: 1) Extend corpus with at least one HTML-based statute or administrative code. 2) Begin segmentation heuristic audit once additional formats are parsed.

## 2025-11-15T04:55:00Z – Workstream A: Corpus Plan Finalization & Parsing Config Update
- tasks: Finalized six-source governance corpus roster, noted acquisition status, broadened `config/kb-processing.yaml` for HTML/PDF/DOCX overrides, and verified parsed artifacts/README entries align with the plan.
- commands: `/home/ubuntu/speculum-principum/.venv/bin/python -m main parse --output-root evidence/parsed html "evidence/Agriculture, Water & Natural Resources.htm"`
- verification: HTML parse exited 0; new directory `agriculture-water-natural-resources-html-5a4a0c3fd2f6/` generated under `evidence/parsed/2025/` with `index.md`, `combined.md`, and asset references. Confirmed updated config includes HTML/DOCX suffixes plus format profiles, linted YAML via manual review, and rechecked existing parsed directories (`application-of-the-colorado-common-interest-owne-1fd3070980ab/`, `fy25-26apprept-pdf-90c4d8d76e61/`) to ensure metadata matches README entries.
- quality_review: HTML output preserves committee membership table and biography snippets without duplicating navigation menus; hero/footer blocks stripped as intended. Corpus roster now covers all required tiers—Colorado Constitution (PDF, pending download), Texas Administrative Code Title 1 (HTML, pending capture), Miami-Dade Home Rule Charter (PDF, pending), King County Code Title 2 (HTML, pending), Los Angeles County FY25 Budget Exec Summary (PDF, pending), DRCOG Transportation Planning Agreement (PDF, pending), alongside parsed Colorado HOA summary, FY25-26 budget appropriations report, and new Colorado General Assembly committee HTML page.
- fixes_applied: Expanded `config/kb-processing.yaml` scan suffixes and introduced format-specific overrides (PDF OCR flags, HTML selector lists, DOCX normalization toggles) to prep for mixed-format intake; stored raw HTML plus dependent assets in `evidence/` for reproducibility.
- remaining_issues: Awaiting local copies for the four remaining documents; need additional HTML download/normalization workflow improvements before Workstream B segmentation tuning. No new PDF artifacts generated until sources available.
- next_steps: 1) Source/download remaining four documents (prefer storing under `evidence/raw/` before parsing). 2) Once additional assets acquired, rerun `python -m main parse` for each and update README entries, then proceed to Workstream B.
