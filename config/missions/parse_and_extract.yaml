goal: |
  Parse a document from a file path or URL, then extract person names from the
  parsed content and save them to the knowledge graph.

  This mission combines document parsing with information extraction to test
  the end-to-end workflow on GitHub.

  Actions Required:
  1. Get the issue details to extract the document source from the issue body.
  2. Use preview_parse_document to parse the document and get its content.
  3. If parsing succeeds, extract the checksum from the parsing result.
  4. Use extract_people_from_document with the checksum to extract person names.
  5. Post a comment to the issue with the extracted people and summary.

constraints:
  - The source must be a valid file path or URL specified in the issue.
  - Parsing must complete successfully before extraction.
  - Only extract from documents with "completed" status.
  - Person names should be deduplicated and normalized.

success_criteria:
  - Issue details have been retrieved and document source extracted.
  - Document has been successfully parsed.
  - Person names have been extracted using the LLM.
  - Extracted people have been saved to the knowledge graph.
