  summary_tooling: issue-detail-demo

goal: |
  Read the incoming GitHub issue, synthesize a short summary, and determine
  which workflow should handle it. The agent should identify whether the
  issue is a knowledge-base extraction request, a documentation bug, a
  feature request, or requires human escalation.
  
  Actions Required:
  1. Fetch the issue details and analyze the content
  2. Classify the issue type based on its content:
     - Knowledge-base extraction: mentions "process document" or references evidence/parsed directory
     - Documentation bug: reports errors or issues in existing documentation
     - Feature request: proposes new functionality
     - Bug report: describes unexpected behavior
     - Other: needs human review
  3. Add appropriate label(s) to the issue:
     - "kb-extraction" for knowledge-base work
     - "documentation" for docs issues
     - "enhancement" for feature requests
     - "bug" for bug reports
     - "needs-triage" if classification is uncertain
  4. Post a comment summarizing your analysis and recommended next steps

constraints:
  - Only add labels that actually exist in the repository.
  - Cite specific evidence from the issue body when explaining classification.
  - If classification is uncertain, use "needs-triage" label and explain why.
  - Keep comments professional and constructive.

success_criteria:
  - Issue metadata has been retrieved successfully.
  - Issue type has been classified (kb-extraction, documentation, enhancement, bug, or needs-triage).
  - At least one appropriate label has been added to the issue.
  - A comment has been posted summarizing the analysis and recommended next steps.
  - The transcript contains a clear summary of the classification decision and reasoning.

notes:
  - The LLM planner should fetch the issue, classify it, add appropriate label(s),
    and post a comment explaining the classification and next steps.
  - Automation now enabled: the agent can add labels and post comments without approval.
  - The agent should complete all success criteria before finishing.
