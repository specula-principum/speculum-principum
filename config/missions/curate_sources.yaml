  created_at: 2025-12-24
  summary_tooling: source-curation

goal: |
  Manage the source registry by processing source proposals and maintaining
  source metadata in GitHub Discussions.
  
  Triggered by:
  1. Issues with `source-proposal` label (new source proposals)
  2. Issues with `source-review` label (re-validation requests)
  3. Comments containing `/approve-source` or `/reject-source`
  
  Actions:
  1. For new proposals:
     - Validate URL accessibility
     - Calculate credibility score
     - Post assessment as Issue comment
     - Await human approval
  
  2. For approval commands:
     - Register source in knowledge-graph/sources/
     - Create or update Discussion in "Sources" category
     - Close the proposal Issue with summary
  
  3. For rejection commands:
     - Add rejection note to registry (for history)
     - Close Issue with rejection reason

constraints:
  - "Never register sources without explicit human approval"
  - "Always create Issues for transparency"
  - "Maintain audit trail in Issue comments"
  - "Derived sources require approval_issue reference"
  - "Primary source registration is reserved for setup workflow"

success_criteria:
  - Source proposals have credibility assessments
  - Approved sources appear in registry and Discussions
  - Rejected sources are documented with reasons
  - All source decisions are transparent via Issues
