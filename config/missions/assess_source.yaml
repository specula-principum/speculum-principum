goal: |
  Assess source proposals in GitHub Discussions and post credibility analysis.
  
  Triggered by:
  1. New Discussions created in the "Sources" category
  2. Discussions updated with new information requiring re-assessment
  
  Actions:
  1. Read the Discussion to extract the proposed URL
  2. Validate URL accessibility (HTTP HEAD request)
  3. Calculate credibility score based on domain characteristics
  4. Post assessment as a Discussion reply with:
     - Credibility score
     - Domain type (government, education, organization, etc.)
     - Integrity indicators (accessibility, SSL, content type)
     - Recommendation (approve/review carefully)

constraints:
  - "Only assess Discussions in the 'Sources' category"
  - "Do not create Issues - assessment only"
  - "Post assessment as reply, not edit to original Discussion"
  - "Do not approve or reject - only provide assessment"

success_criteria:
  - All source proposals have credibility assessments posted as replies
  - Assessments include score, domain type, and integrity indicators
  - Assessment is objective and based on verifiable criteria
