  summary_tooling: extraction-check-demo

goal: |
  Validate that a KB extraction issue contains all required template fields
  before automated processing begins. The agent should verify the presence of
  source path, source type, extraction requirements, output requirements, and
  success criteria.

constraints:
  - Perform only read-only operations.
  - Do not modify the issue during validation.
  - Cite specific missing fields if template is incomplete.

success_criteria:
  - Issue metadata has been retrieved successfully.
  - Template validation has been performed.
  - A validation report with recommended actions has been produced.

max_steps: 5
allowed_tools:
  - get_issue_details
  - get_ready_for_copilot_issue
requires_approval: false

observability:
  transcript_required: true
  capture_summary: true

notes:
  - The deterministic planner should fetch the issue and run template validation.
  - "Validation checks for 5 required fields: source_path, source_type, extraction_requirements, output_requirements, success_criteria."
  - If 3+ fields are missing, recommend using the kb-extract-source.md template.
  - If 1-2 fields are missing, recommend requesting clarification.
  - If all fields present, recommend proceeding with extraction workflow.
