  Execute the complete knowledge base extraction workflow end-to-end:
  1. Validate the issue contains required information:
     - Source path or URL to extract from
     - Target knowledge base directory
     - Any specific extraction requirements
  2. If validation fails, post a comment explaining missing information and stop
  3. Extract knowledge from the specified source using the parsing tools
  4. Validate the extracted knowledge base structure
  5. Generate a quality report on the extraction
  6. Post the quality report as a comment on the issue
  7. If extraction succeeded, add "kb-extracted" label
  8. If extraction failed, add "kb-extraction-failed" label and explain why

constraints:
  - Do not close the issue (human review required)
  - Do not modify the original source files
  - Ensure extracted knowledge follows repository conventions
  - Post detailed quality metrics in the report
  - Cite specific validation errors if extraction fails

  - Issue requirements were validated
  - Knowledge extraction was attempted from specified source
  - KB validation was run on extracted content
  - Quality report was posted as comment
  - Appropriate completion label was applied
  - No unauthorized file modifications occurred
