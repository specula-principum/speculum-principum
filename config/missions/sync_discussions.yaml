goal: |
  Synchronize knowledge graph entities (people and organizations) to GitHub Discussions.
  
  For each entity in the knowledge graph:
  1. Check if a discussion already exists with the entity's name as the title
  2. If no discussion exists, create one in the appropriate category (People or Organizations)
  3. If a discussion exists but content differs, update it and add a changelog comment
  4. If a discussion exists and content matches, skip (no action needed)

  The discussion body should contain:
  - Entity summary and attributes
  - Associated relationships with evidence
  - Related concepts
  - Source document references
  - Confidence scores

constraints:
  - "Categories 'People' and 'Organizations' must exist (create if missing)"
  - "Use consistent title format (exact entity name)"
  - "Only update discussions when content actually changes"
  - "Add changelog comments documenting each update"
  - "Process one entity at a time to allow review"

success_criteria:
  - All entities in knowledge graph have corresponding discussions
  - Discussion bodies reflect current knowledge graph state
  - Changelog comments track update history
  - No duplicate discussions created
