  owner: copilot-orchestrator
  created_at: 2025-11-02
  summary_tooling: parsing-preview-demo

goal: |
  Identify candidate source documents for knowledge base onboarding, generate a
  sanitized Markdown preview, and outline how the preview populates the KB
  source template for operator review.

constraints:
  - Operate in read-only mode; never persist artifacts outside mission storage.
  - Limit each run to a single preview unless the mission explicitly requests more.
  - When no documents match the filters, surface the filters you applied and recommend next steps.

success_criteria:
  - Candidate list retrieved or justified as empty within the transcript.
  - Preview content captured in the mission summary with truncation status noted.
  - Summary links preview insights to specific sections of knowledge-base/meta/templates/source.md.

max_steps: 6
allowed_tools:
  - list_parse_candidates
  - preview_parse_document
requires_approval: false

observability:
  transcript_required: true
  capture_summary: true

notes:
  - Expect context inputs: parse_root (required), source_path (optional), expected_parser (optional), max_preview_chars (optional).
  - Deterministic planners should stash preview payloads in context for downstream evaluators.
  - Operators can map preview excerpts to Source Summary, tags, and dublin_core fields immediately after mission completion.
